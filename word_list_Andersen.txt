the
emperor’s
new
clothes
many
years
ago
there
was
an
emperor
who
was
so
excessively
fond
of
new
clothes
that
he
spent
all
his
money
in
dress
he
did
not
trouble
himself
in
the
least
about
his
soldiers
nor
did
he
care
to
go
either
to
the
theatre
or
the
chase
except
for
the
opportunities
then
afforded
him
for
displaying
his
new
clothes
he
had
a
different
suit
for
each
hour
of
the
day
and
as
of
any
other
king
or
emperor
one
is
accustomed
to
say
he
is
sitting
in
council
it
was
always
said
of
him
the
emperor
is
sitting
in
his
wardrobe
time
passed
merrily
in
the
large
town
which
was
his
capital
strangers
arrived
every
day
at
the
court
one
day
two
rogues
calling
themselves
weavers
made
their
appearance
they
gave
out
that
they
knew
how
to
weave
stuffs
of
the
most
beautiful
colors
and
elaborate
patterns
the
clothes
manufactured
from
which
should
have
the
wonderful
property
of
remaining
invisible
to
everyone
who
was
unfit
for
the
office
he
held
or
who
was
extraordinarily
simple
in
character
these
must
indeed
be
splendid
clothes
thought
the
emperor
had
i
such
a
suit
i
might
at
once
find
out
what
men
in
my
realms
are
unfit
for
their
office
and
also
be
able
to
distinguish
the
wise
from
the
foolish
this
stuff
must
be
woven
for
me
immediately
and
he
caused
large
sums
of
money
to
be
given
to
both
the
weavers
in
order
that
they
might
begin
their
work
directly
so
the
two
pretended
weavers
set
up
two
looms
and
affected
to
work
very
busily
though
in
reality
they
did
nothing
at
all
they
asked
for
the
most
delicate
silk
and
the
purest
gold
thread
put
both
into
their
own
knapsacks
and
then
continued
their
pretended
work
at
the
empty
looms
until
late
at
night
i
should
like
to
know
how
the
weavers
are
getting
on
with
my
cloth
said
the
emperor
to
himself
after
some
little
time
had
elapsed
he
was
however
rather
embarrassed
when
he
remembered
that
a
simpleton
or
one
unfit
for
his
office
would
be
unable
to
see
the
manufacture
to
be
sure
he
thought
he
had
nothing
to
risk
in
his
own
person
but
yet
he
would
prefer
sending
somebody
else
to
bring
him
intelligence
about
the
weavers
and
their
work
before
he
troubled
himself
in
the
affair
all
the
people
throughout
the
city
had
heard
of
the
wonderful
property
the
cloth
was
to
possess
and
all
were
anxious
to
learn
how
wise
or
how
ignorant
their
neighbors
might
prove
to
be
i
will
send
my
faithful
old
minister
to
the
weavers
said
the
emperor
at
last
after
some
deliberation
he
will
be
best
able
to
see
how
the
cloth
looks
for
he
is
a
man
of
sense
and
no
one
can
be
more
suitable
for
his
office
than
he
is
so
the
faithful
old
minister
went
into
the
hall
where
the
knaves
were
working
with
all
their
might
at
their
empty
looms
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
thought
the
old
man
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
i
cannot
discover
the
least
bit
of
thread
on
the
looms
however
he
did
not
express
his
thoughts
aloud
the
impostors
requested
him
very
courteously
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
nearer
their
looms
and
then
asked
him
whether
the
design
pleased
him
and
whether
the
colors
were
not
very
beautiful
at
the
same
time
pointing
to
the
empty
frames
the
poor
old
minister
looked
and
looked
he
could
not
discover
anything
on
the
looms
for
a
very
good
reason
viz
there
was
nothing
there
what
thought
he
again
is
it
possible
that
i
am
a
simpleton
i
have
never
thought
so
myself
and
no
one
must
know
it
now
if
i
am
so
can
it
be
that
i
am
unfit
for
my
office
no
that
must
not
be
said
either
i
will
never
confess
that
i
could
not
see
the
stuff
well
sir
minister
said
one
of
the
knaves
still
pretending
to
work
you
do
not
say
whether
the
stuff
pleases
you

oh
it
is
excellent
replied
the
old
minister
looking
at
the
loom
through
his
spectacles
this
pattern
and
the
colors
yes
i
will
tell
the
emperor
without
delay
how
very
beautiful
i
think
them
we
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
impostors
and
then
they
named
the
different
colors
and
described
the
pattern
of
the
pretended
stuff
the
old
minister
listened
attentively
to
their
words
in
order
that
he
might
repeat
them
to
the
emperor
and
then
the
knaves
asked
for
more
silk
and
gold
saying
that
it
was
necessary
to
complete
what
they
had
begun
however
they
put
all
that
was
given
them
into
their
knapsacks
and
continued
to
work
with
as
much
apparent
diligence
as
before
at
their
empty
looms
the
emperor
now
sent
another
officer
of
his
court
to
see
how
the
men
were
getting
on
and
to
ascertain
whether
the
cloth
would
soon
be
ready
it
was
just
the
same
with
this
gentleman
as
with
the
minister
he
surveyed
the
looms
on
all
sides
but
could
see
nothing
at
all
but
the
empty
frames
does
not
the
stuff
appear
as
beautiful
to
you
as
it
did
to
my
lord
the
minister
asked
the
impostors
of
the
emperor’s
second
ambassador
at
the
same
time
making
the
same
gestures
as
before
and
talking
of
the
design
and
colors
which
were
not
there
i
certainly
am
not
stupid
thought
the
messenger
it
must
be
that
i
am
not
fit
for
my
good
profitable
office
that
is
very
odd
however
no
one
shall
know
anything
about
it
and
accordingly
he
praised
the
stuff
he
could
not
see
and
declared
that
he
was
delighted
with
both
colors
and
patterns
indeed
please
your
imperial
majesty
said
he
to
his
sovereign
when
he
returned
the
cloth
which
the
weavers
are
preparing
is
extraordinarily
magnificent
the
whole
city
was
talking
of
the
splendid
cloth
which
the
emperor
had
ordered
to
be
woven
at
his
own
expense
and
now
the
emperor
himself
wished
to
see
the
costly
manufacture
while
it
was
still
in
the
loom
accompanied
by
a
select
number
of
officers
of
the
court
among
whom
were
the
two
honest
men
who
had
already
admired
the
cloth
he
went
to
the
crafty
impostors
who
as
soon
as
they
were
aware
of
the
emperor’s
approach
went
on
working
more
diligently
than
ever
although
they
still
did
not
pass
a
single
thread
through
the
looms
is
not
the
work
absolutely
magnificent
said
the
two
officers
of
the
crown
already
mentioned
if
your
majesty
will
only
be
pleased
to
look
at
it
what
a
splendid
design
what
glorious
colors
and
at
the
same
time
they
pointed
to
the
empty
frames
for
they
imagined
that
everyone
else
could
see
this
exquisite
piece
of
workmanship
how
is
this
said
the
emperor
to
himself
i
can
see
nothing
this
is
indeed
a
terrible
affair
am
i
a
simpleton
or
am
i
unfit
to
be
an
emperor
that
would
be
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen—oh
the
cloth
is
charming
said
he
aloud
it
has
my
complete
approbation
and
he
smiled
most
graciously
and
looked
closely
at
the
empty
looms
for
on
no
account
would
he
say
that
he
could
not
see
what
two
of
the
officers
of
his
court
had
praised
so
much
all
his
retinue
now
strained
their
eyes
hoping
to
discover
something
on
the
looms
but
they
could
see
no
more
than
the
others
nevertheless
they
all
exclaimed
oh
how
beautiful
and
advised
his
majesty
to
have
some
new
clothes
made
from
this
splendid
material
for
the
approaching
procession
magnificent
charming
excellent
resounded
on
all
sides
and
everyone
was
uncommonly
gay
the
emperor
shared
in
the
general
satisfaction
and
presented
the
impostors
with
the
riband
of
an
order
of
knighthood
to
be
worn
in
their
button-holes
and
the
title
of
gentlemen
weavers
the
rogues
sat
up
the
whole
of
the
night
before
the
day
on
which
the
procession
was
to
take
place
and
had
sixteen
lights
burning
so
that
everyone
might
see
how
anxious
they
were
to
finish
the
emperor’s
new
suit
they
pretended
to
roll
the
cloth
off
the
looms
cut
the
air
with
their
scissors

and
sewed
with
needles
without
any
thread
in
them
see
cried
they
at
last
the
emperor’s
new
clothes
are
ready
and
now
the
emperor
with
all
the
grandees
of
his
court
came
to
the
weavers
and
the
rogues
raised
their
arms
as
if
in
the
act
of
holding
something
up
saying
here
are
your
majesty’s
trousers
here
is
the
scarf
here
is
the
mantle
the
whole
suit
is
as
light
as
a
cobweb
one
might
fancy
one
has
nothing
at
all
on
when
dressed
in
it
that
however
is
the
great
virtue
of
this
delicate
cloth
yes
indeed
said
all
the
courtiers
although
not
one
of
them
could
see
anything
of
this
exquisite
manufacture
if
your
imperial
majesty
will
be
graciously
pleased
to
take
off
your
clothes
we
will
fit
on
the
new
suit
in
front
of
the
looking
glass
the
emperor
was
accordingly
undressed
and
the
rogues
pretended
to
array
him
in
his
new
suit
the
emperor
turning
round
from
side
to
side
before
the
looking
glass
how
splendid
his
majesty
looks
in
his
new
clothes
and
how
well
they
fit
everyone
cried
out
what
a
design
what
colors
these
are
indeed
royal
robes
the
canopy
which
is
to
be
borne
over
your
majesty
in

procession
is
waiting
announced
the
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
i
am
quite
ready
answered
the
emperor
do
my
new
clothes
fit
well
asked
he
turning
himself
round
again
before
the
looking
glass
in
order
that
he
might
appear
to
be
examining
his
handsome
suit
the
lords
of
the
bedchamber
who
were
to
carry
his
majesty’s
train
felt
about
on
the
ground
as
if
they
were
lifting
up
the
ends
of
the
mantle
and
pretended
to
be
carrying
something
for
they
would
by
no
means
betray
anything
like
simplicity
or
unfitness
for
their
office
so
now
the
emperor
walked
under
his
high
canopy
in
the
midst
of
the
procession
through
the
streets
of
his
capital
and
all
the
people
standing
by
and
those
at
the
windows
cried
out
oh
how
beautiful
are
our
emperor’s
new
clothes
what
a
magnificent
train
there
is
to
the
mantle
and
how
gracefully
the
scarf
hangs
in
short
no
one
would
allow
that
he
could
not
see
these
much-admired
clothes
because
in
doing
so
he
would
have
declared
himself
either
a
simpleton
or
unfit
for
his
office
certainly
none
of
the
emperor’s
various
suits
had
ever
made
so
great
an
impression
as
these
invisible
ones
but
the
emperor
has
nothing
at
all
on
said
a
little
child
listen
to
the
voice
of
innocence
exclaimed
his
father
and
what
the
child
had
said
was
whispered
from
one
to
another
but
he
has
nothing
at
all
on
at
last
cried
out
all
the
people
the
emperor
was
vexed
for
he
knew
that
the
people
were
right
but
he
thought
the
procession
must
go
on
now
and
the
lords
of
the
bedchamber
took
greater
pains
than
ever
to
appear
holding
up
a
train
although
in
reality
there
was
no
train

hold

the
swineherd
there
was
once
a
poor
prince
who
had
a
kingdom
his
kingdom
was
very
small
but
still
quite
large
enough
to
marry
upon
and
he
wished
to
marry
it
was
certainly
rather
cool
of
him
to
say
to
the
emperor’s
daughter
will
you
have
me
but
so
he
did
for
his
name
was
renowned
far
and
wide
and
there
were
a
hundred
princesses
who
would
have
answered
yes
and
thank
you
kindly
we
shall
see
what
this
princess
said
listen
it
happened
that
where
the
prince’s
father
lay
buried
there
grew
a
rose
tree—a
most
beautiful
rose
tree
which
blossomed
only
once
in
every
five
years
and
even
then
bore
only
one
flower
but
that
was
a
rose
it
smelt
so
sweet
that
all
cares
and
sorrows
were
forgotten
by
him
who
inhaled
its
fragrance
and
furthermore
the
prince
had
a
nightingale
who
could
sing
in
such
a
manner
that
it
seemed
as
though
all
sweet
melodies
dwelt
in
her
little
throat
so
the
princess
was
to
have
the
rose
and
the
nightingale
and
they
were
accordingly
put
into
large
silver
caskets
and
sent
to
her
the
emperor
had
them
brought
into
a
large
hall
where
the
princess
was
playing
at
visiting
with
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
when
she
saw
the
caskets
with
the
presents
she
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
ah
if
it
were
but
a
little
pussy-cat
said
she
but
the
rose
tree
with
its
beautiful
rose
came
to
view
oh
how
prettily
it
is
made
said
all
the
court
ladies
it
is
more
than
pretty
said
the
emperor
it
is
charming
but
the
princess
touched
it
and
was
almost
ready
to
cry
fie
papa
said
she
it
is
not
made
at
all
it
is
natural
let
us
see
what
is
in
the
other
casket
before
we
get
into
a
bad
humor
said
the
emperor
so
the
nightingale
came
forth
and
sang
so
delightfully
that
at
first
no
one
could
say
anything
ill-humored
of
her
superbe
charmant
exclaimed
the
ladies
for
they
all
used
to
chatter
french
each
one
worse
than
her
neighbor
how
much
the
bird
reminds
me
of
the
musical
box
that
belonged
to
our
blessed
empress
said
an
old
knight
oh
yes
these
are
the
same
tones
the
same
execution
yes
yes
said
the
emperor
and
he
wept
like
a
child
at
the
remembrance
i
will
still
hope
that
it
is
not
a
real
bird
said
the
princess
yes
it
is
a
real
bird
said
those
who
had
brought
it
well
then
let
the
bird
fly
said
the
princess
and
she
positively
refused
to
see
the
prince
however
he
was
not
to
be
discouraged
he
daubed
his
face
over
brown
and
black
pulled
his
cap
over
his
ears
and
knocked
at
the
door

the
prince
was
appointed
imperial
swineherd
he
had
a
dirty
little
room
close
by
the
pigsty
and
there
he
sat
the
whole
day
and
worked
by
the
evening
he
had
made
a
pretty
little
kitchen-pot
little
bells
were
hung
all
round
it
and
when
the
pot
was
boiling
these
bells
tinkled
in
the
most
charming
manner
and
played
the
old
melody
ach
du
lieber
augustin
alles
ist
weg
weg
weg
ah
dear
augustine
all
is
gone
gone
gone
but
what
was
still
more
curious
whoever
held
his
finger
in
the
smoke
of
the
kitchen-pot
immediately
smelt
all
the
dishes
that
were
cooking
on
every
hearth
in
the
city—this
you
see
was
something
quite
different
from
the
rose
now
the
princess
happened
to
walk
that
way
and
when
she
heard
the
tune
she
stood
quite
still
and
seemed
pleased
for
she
could
play
lieber
augustine
it
was
the
only
piece
she
knew
and
she
played
it
with
one
finger
why
there
is
my
piece
said
the
princess
that
swineherd
must
certainly
have
been
well
educated
go
in
and
ask
him
the
price
of
the
instrument
so
one
of
the
court-ladies
must
run
in
however
she
drew
on
wooden
slippers
first
what
will
you
take
for
the
kitchen-pot
said
the
lady
i
will
have
ten
kisses
from
the
princess
said
the
swineherd
yes
indeed
said
the
lady
i
cannot
sell
it
for
less
rejoined
the
swineherd
he
is
an
impudent
fellow
said
the
princess
and
she
walked
on
but
when
she
had
gone
a
little
way
the
bells
tinkled
so
prettily
ach
du
lieber
augustin
alles
ist
weg
weg
weg
stay
said
the
princess
ask
him
if
he
will
have
ten
kisses
from
the
ladies
of
my
court
no
thank
you
said
the
swineherd
ten
kisses
from
the
princess
or
i
keep
the
kitchen-pot
myself
that
must
not
be
either
said
the
princess
but
do
you
all
stand
before
me
that
no
one
may
see
us
and
the
court-ladies
placed
themselves
in
front
of
her
and
spread
out
their
dresses—the
swineherd
got
ten
kisses
and
the
princess—the
kitchen-pot
that
was
delightful
the
pot
was
boiling
the
whole
evening
and
the
whole
of
the
following
day
they
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
cooking
at
every
fire
throughout
the
city
from
the
chamberlain’s
to
the
cobbler’s
the
court-ladies
danced
and
clapped
their
hands
we
know
who
has
soup
and
who
has
pancakes
for
dinner
to-day
who
has
cutlets
and
who
has
eggs
how
interesting
yes
but
keep
my
secret
for

the
swineherd—that
is
to
say—the
prince
for
no
one
knew
that
he
was
other
than
an
ill-favored
swineherd
let
not
a
day
pass
without
working
at
something
he
at
last
constructed
a
rattle
which
when
it
was
swung
round
played
all
the
waltzes
and
jig
tunes
which
have
ever
been
heard
since
the
creation
of
the
world
ah
that
is
superbe
said
the
princess
when
she
passed
by
i
have
never
heard
prettier
compositions
go
in
and
ask
him
the
price
of
the
instrument
but
mind
he
shall
have
no
more
kisses
he
will
have
a
hundred
kisses
from
the
princess
said
the
lady
who
had
been
to
ask
i
think
he
is
not
in
his
right
senses
said
the
princess
and
walked
on
but
when
she
had
gone
a
little
way
she
stopped
again
one
must
encourage
art
said
she
i
am
the
emperor’s
daughter
tell
him
he
shall
as
on
yesterday
have
ten
kisses
from
me
and
may
take
the
rest
from
the
ladies
of
the
court
oh—but
we
should
not
like
that
at
all
said
they
what
are
you
muttering
asked
the
princess
if
i
can
kiss
him
surely
you
can
remember
that
you
owe
everything
to
me
so
the
ladies
were
obliged
to
go
to
him
again
a
hundred
kisses
from
the
princess
said
he
or
else
let
everyone
keep
his
own
stand
round
said
she
and
all
the
ladies
stood
round
her
whilst
the
kissing
was
going
on
what
can
be
the
reason
for
such
a
crowd
close
by
the
pigsty
said
the
emperor
who
happened
just
then
to
step
out
on
the
balcony
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
put
on
his
spectacles
they
are
the
ladies
of
the
court
i
must
go
down
and
see
what
they
are
about
so
he
pulled
up
his
slippers
at
the
heel
for
he
had
trodden
them
down
as
soon
as
he
had
got
into
the
court-yard
he
moved
very
softly
and
the
ladies
were
so
much
engrossed
with
counting
the
kisses
that
all
might
go
on
fairly
that
they
did
not
perceive
the
emperor
he
rose
on
his
tiptoes
what
is
all
this
said
he
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
and
he
boxed
the
princess’s
ears
with
his
slipper
just
as
the
swineherd
was
taking
the
eighty-sixth
kiss
march
out
said
the
emperor
for
he
was
very
angry
and
both
princess
and
swineherd
were
thrust
out
of
the
city
the
princess
now
stood
and
wept
the
swineherd
scolded
and
the
rain
poured
down
alas
unhappy
creature
that
i
am
said
the
princess
if
i
had
but
married
the
handsome
young
prince
ah
how
unfortunate
i
am
and
the
swineherd
went
behind
a
tree
washed
the
black
and
brown
color
from
his
face
threw
off
his
dirty
clothes
and
stepped
forth
in
his
princely
robes
he
looked
so
noble
that
the
princess
could
not
help
bowing
before
him
i
am
come
to
despise
thee
said
he
thou
would’st
not
have
an
honorable
prince
thou
could’st
not
prize
the
rose
and
the
nightingale
but
thou
wast
ready
to
kiss
the
swineherd
for
the
sake
of
a
trumpery
plaything
thou
art
rightly
served
he
then
went
back
to
his
own
little
kingdom
and
shut
the
door
of
his
palace
in
her
face
now
she
might
well

the
real
princess
there
was
once
a
prince
who
wished
to
marry
a
princess
but
then
she
must
be
a
real
princess
he
travelled
all
over
the
world
in
hopes
of
finding
such
a
lady
but
there
was
always
something
wrong
princesses
he
found
in
plenty
but
whether
they
were
real
princesses
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
decide
for
now
one
thing
now
another
seemed
to
him
not
quite
right
about
the
ladies
at
last
he
returned
to
his
palace
quite
cast
down
because
he
wished
so
much
to
have
a
real
princess
for
his
wife
one
evening
a
fearful
tempest
arose
it
thundered
and
lightened
and
the
rain
poured
down
from
the
sky
in
torrents
besides
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
all
at
once
there
was
heard
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
old
king
the
prince’s
father
went
out
himself
to
open
it
it
was
a
princess
who
was
standing
outside
the
door
what
with
the
rain
and
the
wind
she
was
in
a
sad
condition
the
water
trickled
down
from
her
hair
and
her
clothes
clung
to
her
body
she
said
she
was
a
real
princess
ah
we
shall
soon
see
that
thought
the
old
queen-mother
however
she
said
not
a
word
of
what
she
was
going
to
do
but
went
quietly
into
the
bedroom
took
all
the
bed-clothes
off
the
bed
and
put
three
little
peas
on
the
bedstead
she
then
laid
twenty
mattresses
one
upon
another
over
the
three
peas
and
put
twenty
feather
beds
over
the
mattresses
upon
this
bed
the
princess
was
to
pass
the
night
the
next
morning
she
was
asked
how
she
had
slept
oh
very
badly
indeed
she
replied
i
have
scarcely
closed
my
eyes
the
whole
night
through
i
do
not
know
what
was
in
my
bed
but
i
had
something
hard
under
me
and
am
all
over
black
and
blue
it
has
hurt
me
so
much
now
it
was
plain
that
the
lady
must
be
a
real
princess
since
she
had
been
able
to
feel
the
three
little
peas
through
the
twenty
mattresses
and
twenty
feather
beds
none
but
a
real
princess
could
have
had
such
a
delicate
sense
of
feeling
the
prince
accordingly
made
her
his
wife
being
now
convinced
that
he
had
found
a
real
princess
the
three
peas
were
however
put
into
the
cabinet
of
curiosities
where
they
are
still
to
be
seen
provided
they
are
not
lost
wasn’t
this
a
lady
of
real
delicacy

here
then
we
will
stay
for
the
present
in
one
of
the
houses
not
far
from
the
new
market
a
party
was
invited—a
very
large
party
in
order
as
is
often
the
case
to
get
a
return
invitation
from
the
others
one
half
of

was
already
seated
at

the
other
half
awaited

observation
of
the
lady
of
the
house
now
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
to
amuse
ourselves
they
had
got
just
so
far
and
the
conversation
began
to
crystallise
as
it
could
but
do
with
the
scanty
stream
which
the
commonplace
world
supplied
amongst
other
things
they
spoke
of
the
middle
ages
some
praised
that
period
as
far
more
interesting

more
poetical
than
our

too
sober

indeed
councillor
knap
defended
this
opinion
so
warmly
that
the
hostess
declared
immediately
on
his
side
and
both
exerted
themselves
with
unwearied
eloquence
the
councillor
boldly
declared
the
time
of
king
hans
to
be
the
noblest
and
the
most
happy
period
a.d
while
the
conversation
turned
on
this
subject
and
was
only
for
a
moment
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
journal
that
contained
nothing
worth
reading
we
will
just
step
out
into
the
antechamber
where
cloaks

sticks
umbrellas
and

were
deposited
here
sat
two
female
figures
a
young
and
an
old
one
one
might
have
thought
at
first
they
were
servants
come
to
accompany
their
mistresses
home
but
on
looking
nearer
one
soon
saw
they
could
scarcely
be
mere
servants
their
forms
were
too
noble
for
that
their
skin
too
fine
the
cut
of
their
dress
too
striking

extremely
gloomy—it
was
care
she
always
attends
to
her
own
serious
business
herself
as
then
she
is
sure
of
having
it
done
properly
they
were
telling
each
other
with
a
confidential
interchange
of
ideas
where
they
had
been
during
the
day
the

of
fortune
had
only
executed
a
few
unimportant
commissions
such
as

what
she
had

to
perform
was
something
quite
unusual
i
must
tell
you
said
she
that
to-day
is
my
birthday
and
in
honor
of
it
a

of

stupid

said
the

angrily
i
will
put
them
here
by
the
door
some
one
will
make
a
mistake
for
certain
and
take
the
wrong
ones—he

such
was
their
conversation
ii
what
happened
to
the
councillor
it
was
late
councillor
knap
deeply
occupied
with
the
times
of
king
hans
intended
to
go
home
and
malicious
fate
managed
matters
so
that
his
feet
instead
of
finding
their
way
to
his
own
galoshes
slipped
into
those
of
fortune
thus
caparisoned
the
good
man
walked
out
of
the
well
lighted
rooms
into
east
street
by
the
magic
power
of
the
shoes
he
was
carried
back
to
the
times
of
king
hans
on
which
account
his
foot
very
naturally
sank
in
the
mud
and
puddles
of
the
street
there
having
been
in
those
days
no
pavement
in
copenhagen
well
this
is
too
bad
how
dirty
it
is
here
sighed
the
councillor
as
to
a
pavement
i
can
find
no
traces
of
one
and
all
the
lamps
it
seems
have
gone
to
sleep
the
moon
was
not
yet
very
high
it
was
besides
rather
foggy
so
that
in
the
darkness
all
objects
seemed
mingled
in
chaotic
confusion
at
the
next
corner
hung
a
votive
lamp
before
a
madonna
but
the
light
it
gave
was
little
better
than
none
at
all
indeed
he
did
not
observe
it
before
he
was
exactly
under
it
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
bright
colors
of
the
pictures
which
represented
the
well-known
group
of
the
virgin
and
the
infant
jesus
that
is
probably
a
wax-work
show
thought
he
and
the
people
delay
taking
down
their
sign
in
hopes
of
a
late
visitor
or
two
a
few
persons
in
the
costume
of
the
time
of
king
hans
passed
quickly
by
him
how
strange
they
look
the
good
folks
come
probably
from
a
masquerade
suddenly
was
heard
the
sound
of
drums
and
fifes
the
bright
blaze
of
a
fire
shot
up
from
time
to
time
and
its
ruddy
gleams
seemed
to
contend
with
the
bluish
light
of
the
torches
the
councillor
stood
still
and
watched
a
most
strange
procession
pass
by
first
came
a
dozen
drummers
who
understood
pretty
well
how
to
handle
their
instruments
then
came
halberdiers
and
some
armed
with
cross-bows
the
principal
person
in
the
procession
was
a
priest
astonished
at
what
he
saw
the
councillor
asked
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
mummery
and
who
that
man
was
that’s
the
bishop
of
zealand
was
the
answer
good
heavens
what
has
taken
possession
of
the
bishop
sighed
the
councillor
shaking
his
head
it
certainly
could
not
be
the
bishop
even
though
he
was
considered
the
most
absent
man
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
people
told
the
drollest
anecdotes
about
him
reflecting
on
the
matter
and
without
looking
right
or
left
the
councillor
went
through
east
street
and
across
the
habro-platz
the
bridge
leading
to
palace
square
was
not
to
be
found
scarcely
trusting
his

the
nocturnal
wanderer
discovered
a
shallow
piece
of
water
and
here
fell
in
with
two
men

very
comfortably
were

only
just
tell
me
where
the
bridge
is
said
he
it
is
really
unpardonable
that
there
are
no
lamps
here
and
it
is
as
dirty
as
if
one
had
to
wade
through
a
morass
the
longer
he
spoke
with
the
boatmen
the
more
unintelligible
did
their
language
become
to
him
i
don’t
understand
your
bornholmish
dialect
said
he
at
last
angrily
and
turning
his
back
upon
them
he
was
unable
to
find
the
bridge
there
was
no
railway
either
it
is
really
disgraceful
what
a
state
this
place
is
in
muttered
he
to
himself
never
had
his
age
with
which
however
he
was
always
grumbling
seemed
so
miserable
as
on
this
evening
i’ll
take
a
hackney-coach
thought
he
but
where
were
the
hackney-coaches
not
one
was
to
be
seen
i
must
go
back
to
the
new
market
there
it
is
to
be
hoped
i
shall
find
some
coaches
for
if
i
don’t
i
shall
never
get
safe
to
christianshafen
so
off
he
went
in
the
direction
of
east
street
and
had
nearly
got
to
the
end
of
it
when
the
moon
shone
forth
god
bless
me
what
wooden
scaffolding
is
that
which
they
have
set
up
there
cried
he
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
east
gate
which
in
those
days
was
at
the
end
of
east
street
he
found
however
a
little
side-door
open
and
through
this
he
went
and
stepped
into
our
new
market
of
the
present
time
it
was
a
huge
desolate
plain
some
wild
bushes
stood
up
here
and
there
while
across
the
field
flowed
a
broad
canal
or
river
some
wretched
hovels
for
the
dutch
sailors
resembling
great
boxes
and
after
which
the
place
was
named
lay
about
in
confused
disorder
on
the
opposite
bank
i
either
behold
a
fata
morgana
or
i
am
regularly
tipsy
whimpered
out
the
councillor
but
what’s
this
he
turned
round
anew
firmly
convinced
that
he
was
seriously
ill
he
gazed
at
the
street
formerly
so
well
known
to
him
and
now
so
strange
in
appearance
and
looked
at
the
houses
more
attentively
most
of
them
were
of
wood
slightly
put
together
and
many
had
a
thatched
roof
no—i
am
far
from
well
sighed
he
and
yet
i
drank
only
one
glass
of
punch
but
i
cannot
suppose
it—it
was
too
really
very
wrong
to
give
us
punch
and
hot
salmon
for
supper
i
shall
speak
about
it
at
the
first
opportunity
i
have
half
a
mind
to
go
back
again
and
say
what
i
suffer
but
no
that
would
be
too
silly
and
heaven
only
knows
if
they
are
up
still
he
looked
for
the
house
but
it
had
vanished
it
is
really
dreadful
groaned
he
with
increasing
anxiety
i
cannot
recognise
east
street
again
there
is
not
a
single
decent
shop
from
one
end
to
the
other
nothing
but
wretched
huts
can
i
see
anywhere
just
as
if
i
were
at
ringstead
oh
i
am
ill
i
can
scarcely
bear
myself
any
longer
where
the
deuce
can
the
house
be
it
must
be
here
on
this
very
spot
yet
there
is
not
the
slightest
idea
of
resemblance
to
such
a
degree
has
everything
changed
this
night
at
all
events
here
are
some
people
up
and
stirring
oh
oh
i
am
certainly
very
ill
he
now
hit
upon
a
half-open
door
through
a
chink
of
which
a
faint
light
shone
it
was
a
sort
of
hostelry
of
those
times
a
kind
of
public-house
the
room
had
some
resemblance
to
the
clay-floored
halls
in
holstein
a
pretty
numerous
company
consisting
of
seamen
copenhagen
burghers
and
a
few
scholars
sat
here
in
deep
converse
over
their
pewter
cans
and
gave
little
heed
to
the
person
who
entered
by
your
leave
said
the
councillor
to
the
hostess
who
came
bustling
towards
him
i’ve
felt
so
queer
all
of
a
sudden
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
send
for
a

the
woman
examined
him
with
eyes
of
astonishment
and
shook
her
head
she
then
addressed
him
in
german
the
councillor
thought
she
did
not
understand
danish
and
therefore
repeated
his
wish
in
german
this
in
connection
with
his
costume
strengthened
the
good
woman
in
the
belief
that
he
was
a
foreigner
that
he
was
ill
she
comprehended
directly
so
she
brought
him
a
pitcher
of
water
which
tasted
certainly
pretty
strong
of
the
sea
although
it
had
been
fetched
from
the
well
the
councillor
supported
his
head
on
his
hand
drew
a
long
breath
and
thought
over
all
the
wondrous
things
he
saw
around
him
is
this
the
daily
news
of
this
evening
he
asked
mechanically
as
he
saw
the
hostess
push
aside
a
large
sheet
of
paper
the
meaning
of
this
councillorship
query
remained
of
course
a
riddle
to
her
yet
she
handed
him
the
paper
without
replying
it
was
a
coarse
wood-cut
representing
a
splendid
meteor
as
seen
in
the
town
of
cologne
which
was
to
be
read
below
in
bright
letters
that
is
very
old
said
the
councillor
whom
this
piece
of
antiquity
began
to
make
considerably
more
cheerful
pray
how
did
you
come
into
possession
of
this
rare
print
it
is
extremely
interesting
although
the
whole
is
a
mere
fable
such
meteorous
appearances
are
to
be
explained
in
this
way—that
they
are
the
reflections
of
the
aurora
borealis
and
it
is
highly
probable
they
are
caused
principally
by
electricity
those
persons
who
were
sitting
nearest
him
and
heard
his
speech
stared
at
him
in
wonderment
and
one
of
them
rose
took
off
his
hat
respectfully
and
said
with
a
serious
countenance
you
are
no
doubt
a
very
learned
man
monsieur
oh
no
answered
the
councillor
i
can
only
join
in
conversation
on
this
topic
and
on
that
as
indeed
one
must
do
according
to
the
demands
of
the
world
at
present
modestia
is
a
fine
virtue
continued
the
gentleman
however
as
to
your
speech
i
must
say
mihi
secus
videtur
yet
i
am
willing
to
suspend
my
judicium
may
i
ask
with
whom
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
asked
the
councillor
i
am
a
bachelor
in
theologia
answered
the
gentleman
with
a
stiff
reverence
this
reply
fully
satisfied
the
councillor
the
title
suited
the
dress
he
is
certainly
thought
he
some
village
schoolmaster—some
queer
old
fellow
such
as
one
still
often
meets
with
in
jutland
this
is
no
locus
docendi
it
is
true
began
the
clerical
gentleman
yet
i
beg
you
earnestly
to
let
us
profit
by
your
learning
your
reading
in
the
ancients
is
sine
dubio
of
vast
extent
oh
yes
i’ve
read
something
to
be
sure
replied
the
councillor
i
like
reading
all
useful
works
but
i
do
not
on
that
account
despise
the
modern
ones
‘tis
only
the
unfortunate
‘tales
of
every-day
life’
that
i
cannot
bear—we
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
such
in
reality
‘tales
of
every-day
life?’
said
our
bachelor
inquiringly
i
mean
those
new
fangled
novels
twisting
and
writhing
themselves
in
the
dust
of
commonplace
which
also
expect
to
find
a
reading
public
oh
exclaimed
the
clerical
gentleman
smiling
there
is
much
wit
in
them
besides
they
are
read
at
court
the
king
likes
the
history
of
sir
iffven
and
sir
gaudian
particularly
which
treats
of
king
arthur
and
his
knights
of
the
round
table
he
has
more
than
once
joked
about
it
with
his
high
vassals
i
have
not
read
that
novel
said
the
councillor
it
must
be
quite

no
answered
the
theologian
of
the
time
of
king
hans
that
book
is
not
written
by
a
heiberg
but
was
imprinted
by
godfrey
von
gehmen
oh
is
that
the
author’s
name
said
the
councillor
it
is
a
very
old
name
and
as
well
as
i
recollect
he
was
the
first
printer
that
appeared
in
denmark
yes
he
is
our
first
printer
replied
the
clerical
gentleman
hastily
so
far
all
went
on
well
some
one
of
the
worthy
burghers
now
spoke
of
the
dreadful
pestilence
that
had
raged
in
the
country
a
few
years
back
meaning
that
of
the
councillor
imagined
it
was
the
cholera
that
was
meant
which
people
made
so
much
fuss
about
and
the
discourse
passed
off
satisfactorily
enough
the
war
of
the
buccaneers
of
was
so
recent
that
it
could
not
fail
being
alluded
to
the
english
pirates
had
they
said
most
shamefully
taken
their
ships
while
in
the
roadstead
and
the
councillor
before
whose
eyes
the
herostratic
event
of
still
floated
vividly
agreed
entirely
with
the
others
in
abusing
the
rascally
english
with
other
topics
he
was
not
so
fortunate
every
moment
brought
about
some
new
confusion
and
threatened
to
become
a
perfect
babel
for
the
worthy
bachelor
was
really
too
ignorant
and
the
simplest
observations
of
the
councillor
sounded
to
him
too
daring
and
phantastical
they
looked
at
one
another
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
when
matters
grew
to
too
high
a
pitch
then
the
bachelor
talked
latin
in
the
hope
of
being
better
understood—but
it
was
of
no
use
after
all
herostratus
or
eratostratus—an
ephesian
who
wantonly
set
fire
to
the
famous
temple
of
diana
in
order
to
commemorate
his
name
by
so
uncommon
an
action
what’s
the
matter
asked
the
hostess
plucking
the
councillor
by
the
sleeve
and
now
his
recollection
returned
for
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
had
entirely
forgotten
all
that
had
preceded
it
merciful
god
where
am
i
exclaimed
he
in
agony
and
while
he
so
thought
all
his
ideas
and
feelings
of
overpowering
dizziness
against
which
he
struggled
with
the
utmost
power
of
desperation
encompassed
him
with
renewed
force
let
us
drink
claret
and
mead
and
bremen
beer
shouted
one
of
the
guests—“and
you
shall
drink
with
us
two
maidens
approached
one
wore
a
cap
of
two
staring
colors
denoting
the
class
of
persons
to
which
she
belonged
they
poured
out
the
liquor
and
made
the
most
friendly
gesticulations
while
a
cold
perspiration
trickled
down
the
back
of
the
poor
councillor
what’s
to
be
the
end
of
this
what’s
to
become
of
me
groaned
he
but
he
was
forced
in
spite
of
his
opposition
to
drink
with
the
rest
they
took
hold
of
the
worthy
man
who
hearing
on
every
side
that
he
was
intoxicated
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
truth
of
this
certainly
not
very
polite
assertion
but
on
the
contrary
implored
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
to
procure
him
a
hackney-coach
they
however
imagined
he
was
talking
russian
never
before
he
thought
had
he
been
in
such
a
coarse
and
ignorant
company
one
might
almost
fancy
the
people
had
turned
heathens
again
it
is
the
most
dreadful
moment
of
my
life
the
whole
world
is
leagued
against
me
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
stoop
down
under
the
table
and
then
creep
unobserved
out
of
the
door
he
did
so
but
just
as
he
was
going
the
others
remarked
what
he
was
about
they
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
legs
and
now
happily
for
him
off
fell
his
fatal
shoes—and
with
them
the
charm
was
at
an
end
the
councillor
saw
quite
distinctly
before
him
a
lantern
burning
and
behind
this

house
all
seemed
to
him
in
proper
order
as
usual
it
was
east
street
splendid
and
elegant
as
we
now
see
it
he
lay
with
his
feet
towards
a
doorway
and
exactly
opposite
sat
the
watchman
asleep
gracious
heaven
said
he
have
i
lain
here
in
the
street
and
dreamed
yes
‘tis
east
street
how
splendid
and
light
it
is
but
really
it
is
terrible
what
an
effect
that
one
glass
of
punch
must
have
had
on
me
two
minutes
later
he
was
sitting
in
a
hackney-coach
and
driving
to
frederickshafen
he
thought
of
the
distress
and
agony
he
had
endured
and
praised
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
the
happy
reality—our
own
time—which
with
all
its
deficiencies
is
yet
much
better
than
that
in
which
so
much
against
his
inclination
he
had
lately
been
iii
the
watchman’s
adventure
why
there
is
a
pair
of
galoshes
as
sure
as
i’m
alive
said
the
watchman
awaking
from
a
gentle
slumber
they
belong
no
doubt
to
the
lieutenant
who
lives
over
the
way
they
lie
close
to
the
door
the
worthy
man
was
inclined
to
ring
and
deliver
them
at
the
house
for
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
window
but
he
did
not
like
disturbing
the
other
people
in
their
beds
and
so
very
considerately
he
left
the
matter
alone
such
a
pair
of
shoes
must
be
very
warm
and
comfortable
said
he
the
leather
is
so
soft
and
supple
they
fitted
his
feet
as
though
they
had
been
made
for
him
‘tis
a
curious
world
we
live
in
continued
he
soliloquizing
there
is
the
lieutenant
now
who
might
go
quietly
to
bed
if
he
chose
where
no
doubt
he
could
stretch
himself
at
his
ease
but
does
he
do
it
no
he
saunters
up
and
down
his
room
because
probably
he
has
enjoyed
too
many
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
at
his
dinner
that’s
a
happy
fellow
he
has
neither
an
infirm
mother
nor
a
whole
troop
of
everlastingly
hungry
children
to
torment
him
every
evening
he
goes
to
a
party
where
his
nice
supper
costs
him
nothing
would
to
heaven
i
could
but
change
with
him
how
happy
should
i
be
while
expressing
his
wish
the
charm
of
the
shoes
which
he
had
put
on
began
to
work
the
watchman
entered
into
the
being
and
nature
of
the
lieutenant
he
stood
in
the
handsomely
furnished
apartment
and
held
between
his
fingers
a
small
sheet
of
rose-colored
paper
on
which
some
verses
were
written—written
indeed
by
the
officer
himself
for
who
has
not
at
least
once
in
his
life
had
a
lyrical
moment
and
if
one
then
marks
down

of
printing
them

of

there
is
real
poetry
gave
itself
vent
not
that
barren
grief
which
the

may
only
hint
at
but
never
depict
in
its
detail—misery
and
want
that
animal
necessity
in
short

at

at
a
fallen
leaf
of
the
bread-fruit
tree

the
position
in

one

oneself
transplanted
the
greater
is
the
suffering
everyday
necessity
is
the
stagnant
pool
of
life—no
lovely
picture
reflects
itself
therein
lieutenant
love
and
lack
of
money—that
is
a
symbolic
triangle
or
much
the
same
as
the
half
of
the
shattered
die
of
fortune
this
the
lieutenant
felt
most
poignantly
and
this
was
the
reason
he
leant
his
head
against
the
window
and
sighed
so
deeply
the
poor
watchman
out
there
in
the
street
is
far
happier
than
i
he
knows
not
what
i
term
privation
he
has
a
home
a
wife
and
children
who
weep
with
him
over
his
sorrows
who
rejoice
with
him
when
he
is
glad
oh
far
happier
were
i
could
i
exchange
with
him
my
being—with
his
desires
and
with
his
hopes
perform
the
weary
pilgrimage
of
life
oh
he
is
a
hundred
times
happier
than
i
in
the
same
moment
the
watchman
was
again
watchman
it
was
the
shoes
that
caused
the
metamorphosis
by
means
of
which
unknown
to
himself
he
took
upon
him
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
officer
but
as
we
have
just
seen
he
felt
himself
in
his
new
situation
much
less
contented
and
now
preferred
the
very
thing
which
but
some
minutes
before
he
had
rejected
so
then
the
watchman
was
again
watchman
that
was
an
unpleasant
dream
said
he
but
‘twas
droll
enough
altogether
i
fancied
that
i
was
the
lieutenant
over
there
and
yet
the
thing
was
not
very
much
to
my
taste
after
all
i
missed
my
good
old
mother
and
the
dear
little
ones
who
almost
tear
me
to
pieces
for
sheer
love
he
seated
himself
once
more
and
nodded
the
dream
continued
to
haunt
him
for
he
still
had
the
shoes
on
his
feet
a
falling
star
shone
in
the
dark
firmament
there
falls
another
star
said
he
but
what
does
it
matter
there
are
always
enough
left
i
should
not
much
mind
examining
the
little
glimmering
things
somewhat
nearer
especially
the
moon
for
that
would
not
slip
so
easily
through
a
man’s
fingers
when
we
die—so
at
least
says
the
student
for
whom
my
wife
does
the
washing—we
shall
fly
about
as
light
as
a
feather
from
one
such
a
star
to
the
other
that’s
of
course
not
true
but
‘twould
be
pretty
enough
if
it
were
so
if
i
could
but
once
take
a
leap
up
there
my
body
might
stay
here

the

the

had
done
the
fifty-two
thousand
of
our

up
to
the
moon
which
as
everyone
knows
was
formed
out
of
matter
much
lighter
than
our
earth
and
is
so
we
should
say
as
soft
as
newly-fallen

himself

of

we

in

measure
realize
to
ourselves
by
beating
the
white
of
an
egg
in
a
glass
of
water
the
matter
of
which
it

was
just

formed

transparent
and
rocking
in

while
above
his
head
our
earth
was
rolling
like
a

fiery
ball
he
perceived
immediately
a
quantity
of
beings
who
were
certainly
what
we
call
men

they
looked
different

us

far

would
without

have
exclaimed
involuntarily

the

spirit
understood
the

of
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
pretty
well
the
selenites
disputed
variously
about
our

expressed
their
doubts
if

down

in

force
the

to
overflow
the

therefore
not

on

run
in

rather
proceed

citizens
to

observe
what
happened

of
the

he
sat
lifeless
on
the
steps
the
morning-star
that
is
to
say
the
heavy
wooden
staff
headed
with
iron
spikes
and
which
had
nothing
else
in

with
its
sparkling
brother
in

glided
from
his

while
his
eyes
were
fixed

stare
on

asked
a
passer-by
but
when
the
watchman
gave
no

the
merry
roysterer
who
was
now
returning
home
from
a
noisy
drinking
bout
took
it
into
his
head
to
try
what
a
tweak
of
the
nose
would
do
on
which
the
supposed
sleeper
lost
his

body
lay
motionless
stretched
out
on
the
pavement
the
man
was
dead
when
the
patrol
came
up
all
his
comrades
who
comprehended
nothing
of
the
whole
affair
were
seized
with
a
dreadful
fright
for

was
and
he
remained
so
the
proper
authorities
were
informed
of
the
circumstance
people
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
and
in
the
morning
the
body
was
carried
to
the
hospital

that
would
be
a
very
pretty
joke

the
spirit
when
it

were

run

finder

we
may
boldly

off

brought
into

thing
that
was

here
was
naturally
to
pull
off

gone
out

iv
a
moment
of
head
importance—an
evening’s
dramatic
readings”—a
most
strange
journey
every
inhabitant
of
copenhagen
knows
from
personal
inspection
how
the
entrance
to
frederick’s
hospital
looks
but
as
it
is
possible
that
others
who
are
not

people
may
also
read

little
work
we
will
beforehand
give
a
short
description
of
it
the
extensive
building
is
separated
from
the
street
by
a
pretty
high
railing
the
thick
iron
bars
of
which
are
so
far
apart
that
in
all
seriousness
it
is
said
some
very
thin
fellow
had
of
a
night
occasionally
squeezed
himself
through
to
go
and
pay
his
little
visits
in
the
town
the
part
of
the
body
most
difficult
to
manage
on
such
occasions
was
no
doubt
the
head
here
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
the
world
long-headed
people
get
through
best
so
much
then
for
the
introduction
one
of
the
young
men
whose
head
in
a
physical
sense
only
might
be
said
to
be
of
the
thickest
had
the
watch
that
evening
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
yet
despite
these
two
obstacles
the
young
man
was
obliged
to
go
out
if
it
were
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
as
to
telling
the
door-keeper
about
it
that
he
thought
was
quite
unnecessary
if
with
a
whole
skin
he
were
able
to
slip
through
the
railings
there
on
the
floor
lay
the
galoshes
which
the
watchman
had
forgotten
he
never
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
they
were
those
of
fortune
and
they
promised
to
do
him
good
service
in
the
wet
so
he
put
them
on
the
question
now
was
if
he
could
squeeze
himself
through
the
grating
for
he
had
never
tried
before
well
there
he
stood
would
to
heaven
i
had
got
my
head
through
said
he
involuntarily
and
instantly
through
it
slipped
easily
and
without
pain
notwithstanding
it
was
pretty
large
and
thick
but
now
the
rest
of
the
body
was
to
be
got
through
ah
i
am
much
too
stout
groaned
he
aloud
while
fixed
as
in
a
vice
i
had
thought
the
head
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
matter—oh
oh
i
really
cannot
squeeze
myself
through
he
now
wanted
to
pull
his
over-hasty
head
back
again
but
he
could
not
for
his
neck
there
was
room
enough
but
for
nothing
more
his
first
feeling
was
of
anger
his
next
that
his
temper
fell
to
zero
the
shoes
of
fortune
had
placed
him
in
the
most
dreadful
situation
and
unfortunately
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
wish
himself
free

contents

heavier
torrents
not
a
creature
was
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
to
reach
up
to
the
bell
was
what
he
did
not
like
to
cry
aloud
for
help
would
have
availed
him
little
besides
how
ashamed
would
he
have
been
to
be
found
caught
in
a
trap
like
an
outwitted
fox
how
was
he
to
twist
himself
through
he
saw
clearly
that
it
was
his
irrevocable
destiny
to
remain
a
prisoner
till
dawn
or
perhaps
even
late
in
the
morning
then
the
smith
must
be
fetched
to
file
away
the
bars
but
all
that
would
not
be
done
so
quickly
as
he
could
think
about
it
the

opposite
would
be

the

booths
with
their
not
very
courtier-like
swarm
of
seamen
would
join
them
out
of
curiosity
and
would
greet
him
with
a
wild
hurrah
while
he
was
standing
in
his
pillory
there
would
be

follows
a
certain
person
had
an
aunt
who
boasted
of
particular
skill
in
fortune-telling
with
cards
and
who
was
constantly
being
stormed
by
persons
that
wanted
to
have
a
peep
into
futurity
but
she
was
full
of
mystery
about
her
art
in
which
a
certain
pair
of
magic
spectacles
did
her
essential
service
her
nephew
a
merry
boy
who
was
his
aunt’s
darling
begged
so
long
for
these
spectacles
that
at
last
she
lent
him
the
treasure
after
having
informed
him
with
many
exhortations
that
in
order
to
execute
the
interesting
trick
he
need
only
repair
to
some
place
where
a
great
many
persons
were
assembled
and
then
from
a
higher
position
whence
he
could
overlook
the
crowd
pass
the
company
in
review
before
him
through
his
spectacles
immediately
‘the
inner
man’
of
each
individual
would
be
displayed
before
him
like
a
game
of
cards
in
which
he
unerringly
might
read
what
the
future
of
every
person
presented
was
to
be
well
pleased
the
little
magician
hastened
away
to
prove
the
powers
of
the
spectacles
in
the
theatre
no
place
seeming
to
him
more
fitted
for
such
a
trial
he
begged
permission
of
the
worthy
audience
and
set
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
a
motley
phantasmagoria
presents
itself
before
him
which
he
describes
in
a
few
satirical
touches
yet
without
expressing
his
opinion
openly
he
tells
the
people
enough
to
set
them
all
thinking
and
guessing
but
in
order
to
hurt
nobody
he
wraps
his
witty
oracular
judgments
in
a
transparent
veil
or
rather
in
a
lurid
thundercloud
shooting
forth
bright
sparks
of
wit
that
they
may
fall
in
the
powder-magazine
of
the
expectant
audience
the
humorous
poem
was
admirably
recited
and
the
speaker
much
applauded
among
the
audience
was
the
young
man
of
the
hospital
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
adventure
of
the
preceding
night
he
had
on
the
shoes
for
as
yet
no
lawful
owner
had
appeared
to
claim
them
and
besides
it
was
so
very
dirty
out-of-doors
they
were
just
the
thing
for
him
he
thought
the
beginning
of
the
poem
he
praised
with
great
generosity
he
even
found
the
idea
original
and
effective
but
that
the
end
of
it
like
the
rhine
was
very
insignificant
proved
in
his
opinion
the
author’s
want
of
invention
he
was
without
genius
etc
this
was
an
excellent
opportunity
to
have
said
something
clever
meanwhile
he
was
haunted
by
the
idea—he
should
like
to
possess
such
a
pair
of
spectacles
himself
then
perhaps
by
using
them
circumspectly
one
would
be
able
to
look
into
people’s
hearts
which
he
thought
would
be
far
more
interesting
than
merely
to
see
what
was
to
happen
next
year
for
that
we
should
all
know
in
proper
time
but
the
other
never
i
can
now
said
he
to
himself
fancy
the
whole
row
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
sitting
there
in
the
front
row
if
one
could
but
see
into
their
hearts—yes
that
would
be
a
revelation—a
sort
of
bazar
in
that
lady
yonder
so
strangely
dressed
i
should
find
for
certain
a
large
milliner’s
shop
in
that
one
the
shop
is
empty
but
it
wants
cleaning
plain
enough
but
there
would
also
be
some
good
stately
shops
among
them
alas
sighed
he
i
know
one
in
which
all
is
stately
but
there
sits
already
a
spruce
young
shopman
which
is
the
only
thing
that’s
amiss
in
the
whole
shop
all
would
be
splendidly
decked
out
and
we
should
hear
‘walk
in
gentlemen
pray
walk
in
here
you
will
find
all
you
please
to
want.’
ah
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
walk
in
and
take
a
trip
right
through
the
hearts
of
those
present
and
behold
to
the
shoes
of
fortune
this
was
the
cue
the
whole
man
shrunk
together
and
a
most
uncommon
journey
through
the
hearts
of
the
front
row
of
spectators
now
began
the
first
heart
through
which
he
came
was
that
of
a
middle-aged
lady
but
he
instantly
fancied
himself
in
the
room
of
the
institution
for
the
cure
of
the
crooked
and
deformed
where
casts
of
mis-shapen
limbs
are
displayed
in
naked
reality
on
the
wall
yet
there
was
this
difference
in
the
institution
the
casts

taken
at
the
entry
of
the
patient
but
here
they
were
retained
and
guarded
in
the
heart
while
the
sound
persons
went
away
they
were
namely
casts
of
female
friends
whose
bodily
or
mental
deformities
were
here
most
faithfully
preserved
with
the
snake-like
writhings
of
an
idea
he
glided
into
another
female
heart
but
this
seemed
to
him
like
a
large
holy
fane
the
white
dove
of
innocence
fluttered
over
the
altar
how
gladly
would
he
have
sunk
upon
his
knees
but
he
must
away
to
the
next
heart
yet
he
still
heard
the
pealing
tones
of
the
organ
and
he
himself
seemed
to
have
become
a
newer
and
a
better
man
he
felt
unworthy
to
tread
the
neighboring
sanctuary
which
a
poor
garret
with
a
sick
bed-rid
mother
revealed
but
god’s
warm
sun
streamed
through
the
open
window
lovely
roses
nodded
from
the
wooden
flower
boxes
on
the
roof

sky-blue
birds

rejoicingly
while

sick
mother
implored

temple
he
now
crept
on
hands
and
feet
through
a
butcher’s
shop
at
least
on
every
side
and
above
and
below
there
was
nought
but
flesh
it
was
the
heart
of
a
most
respectable
rich
man
whose
name
is
certain
to
be
found
in
the
directory
he
was
now
in
the
heart
of
the
wife
of
this
worthy
gentleman
it
was
an
old
dilapidated
mouldering
dovecot
the
husband’s
portrait
was
used
as
a
weather-cock
which
was
connected
in
some
way
or
other
with
the
doors
and
so
they
opened
and
shut
of
their
own
accord
whenever
the
stern
old
husband
turned
round
hereupon
he
wandered
into
a
boudoir
formed
entirely
of
mirrors
like
the
one
in
castle
rosenburg
but
here
the
glasses
magnified
to
an
astonishing
degree
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
like
a
dalai-lama
the
insignificant
self
of
the
person
quite
confounded
at
his
own
greatness
he
then
imagined
he
had
got
into
a
needle-case
full
of
pointed
needles
of
every
size
this
is
certainly
the
heart
of
an
old
maid
thought
he
but
he
was
mistaken
it
was
the
heart
of
a
young
military
man
a
man
as
people
said
of
talent
and
feeling
in
the
greatest
perplexity
he
now
came
out
of
the
last
heart
in
the
row
he
was
unable
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
and
fancied
that
his
too
lively
imagination
had
run
away
with
him
good
heavens
sighed
he
i
have
surely
a
disposition
to
madness—‘tis
dreadfully
hot
here
my
blood
boils
in
my
veins
and
my
head
is
burning
like
a
coal
and
he
now
remembered
the
important
event
of
the
evening
before
how
his
head
had
got
jammed
in
between
the
iron
railings
of
the
hospital
that’s
what
it
is
no
doubt
said
he
i
must
do
something
in
time
under
such
circumstances
a
russian
bath
might
do
me
good
i
only
wish
i
were
already
on
the
upper
bank
in
these
russian
vapor
baths
the
person
extends
himself
on
a
bank
or
form
and
as
he
gets
accustomed
to
the
heat
moves
to
another
higher
up
towards
the
ceiling
where
of
course
the
vapor
is
warmest
in
this
manner
he
ascends
gradually
to
the
highest
and
so
there
he
lay
on
the
uppermost
bank
in
the
vapor-bath
but
with
all
his
clothes
on
in
his
boots
and
galoshes
while
the
hot
drops
fell
scalding
from
the
ceiling
on
his
face
holloa
cried
he
leaping
down
the
bathing
attendant
on
his
side
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
astonishment
when
he
beheld
in
the
bath
a
man
completely
dressed
the
other
however
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
whisper
to
him
‘tis
a
bet
and
i
have
won
it
but
the
first
thing
he
did
as
soon
as
he
got
home
was
to
have
a
large
blister

chest
and
back
to
draw
out
his
madness
the
next
morning
he
had
a
sore
chest
and
a
bleeding
back

the
fright
that
was
all
that
he
had
gained
by
the
shoes
of

v

of
the
copying-clerk
the

whom
we
have
certainly
not
forgotten
thought
meanwhile
of
the
galoshes
he
had
found
and
taken
with
him
to
the
hospital
he
now
went
to
fetch
them
and
as
neither
the
lieutenant
nor
anybody
else
in
the
street
claimed
them
as
his
property
they
were
delivered
over
to
the
police
office
as
on
the
continent
in
all
law
and
police
practices
nothing
is
verbal
but
any
circumstance
however
trifling
is
reduced
to
writing
the
labor
as
well
as
the
number
of
papers
that
thus
accumulate
is
enormous
in
a
police-office
consequently
we
find
copying-clerks
among
many
other
scribes
of
various
denominations
of
which
it
seems
our
hero
was
one
why
i
declare
the
shoes
look
just
like
my
own
said
one
of
the
clerks
eying
the
newly-found
treasure
whose
hidden
powers
even
he
sharp
as
he
was
was
not
able
to
discover
one
must
have
more
than
the
eye
of
a
shoemaker
to
know
one
pair
from
the
other
said
he
soliloquizing
and
putting
at
the
same
time
the
galoshes
in
search
of
an
owner
beside
his
own
in
the
corner
here
sir
said
one
of
the
men
who
panting
brought
him
a
tremendous
pile
of
papers
the
copying-clerk
turned
round
and
spoke
awhile
with
the
man
about
the
reports
and
legal
documents
in
question
but
when
he
had
finished
and
his
eye
fell
again
on
the
shoes
he
was
unable
to
say
whether
those
to
the
left
or
those
to
the
right
belonged
to
him
at
all
events
it
must
be
those
which
are
wet
thought
he
but
this
time
in
spite
of
his
cleverness
he
guessed
quite
wrong
for
it
was
just
those
of
fortune
which
played
as
it
were
into
his
hands
or
rather
on
his
feet
and
why
i
should
like
to
know
are
the
police
never
to
be
wrong
so
he
put
them
on
quickly
stuck
his
papers
in
his
pocket
and
took
besides
a
few
under
his
arm
intending
to
look
them
through
at
home
to
make
the
necessary
notes
it
was
noon
and
the
weather
that
had
threatened
rain
began
to
clear
up
while
gaily
dressed
holiday
folks
filled
the
streets
a
little
trip
to
fredericksburg
would
do
me
no
great
harm
thought
he
for
i
poor
beast
of
burden
that
i
am
have
so
much
to
annoy
me
that
i
don’t
know
what
a

appetite
is
‘tis
a
bitter
crust
alas
at
which
i
am
condemned
to
gnaw
nobody
could
be
more
steady
or
quiet
than
this
young
man
we
therefore
wish
him
joy
of
the
excursion
with
all
our
heart
and
it
will
certainly
be
beneficial
for
a
person
who
leads
so
sedentary
a
life
in
the
park
he
met
a
friend
one
of
our
young
poets
who
told
him
that
the
following
day
he
should
set
out
on
his
long-intended
tour
so
you
are
going
away
again
said
the
clerk
you
are
a
very
free
and

being

others
are
chained
by
the
leg
and
held
fast
to
our

yes
but
it
is

which
ensures
you
the
blessed
bread

the

you
need
feel
no

morrow
when
you
are
old
you
receive

said
the
clerk
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
yet
you
are
the
better
off
to
sit

and
poetise—that
is

has

you
are

year’s
end
to

and
judging
the
most

matters
the

his

it’s
a
strange
race
those
poets
said
the
clerk
who
was
very
fond
of
soliloquizing
i
should
like
some
day
just
for
a
trial
to
take
such
nature
upon
me
and
be
a
poet
myself
i
am
very
sure
i
should
make
no
such
miserable
verses
as
the
others
today
methinks
is
a
most
delicious
day
for
a
poet
nature
seems
anew
to
celebrate
her
awakening
into
life
the
air
is
so
unusually
clear
the
clouds
sail
on
so
buoyantly
and
from
the
green
herbage
a
fragrance
is
exhaled
that
fills
me
with
delight
for
many
a
year
have
i
not
felt
as
at
this
moment
we
see
already
by
the
foregoing
effusion
that
he
is
become
a
poet
to
give
further
proof
of
it
however
would
in
most
cases
be
insipid
for
it
is
a
most
foolish
notion
to
fancy
a
poet
different
from
other
men
among
the
latter
there
may
be
far
more
poetical
natures
than
many
an
acknowledged
poet
when
examined
more
closely
could
boast
of
the
difference
only
is
that
the
poet
possesses
a
better
mental
memory
on
which
account
he
is
able
to
retain
the
feeling
and
the
thought
till
they
can
be
embodied
by
means
of
words
a
faculty
which
the
others
do
not
possess
but
the
transition
from
a
commonplace
nature
to
one
that
is
richly
endowed
demands
always
a
more
or
less
breakneck
leap
over
a
certain
abyss
which
yawns
threateningly
below
and
thus
must
the
sudden
change
with
the
clerk
strike
the
reader
the
sweet
air
continued
he
of
the
police-office
in
his
dreamy
imaginings
how
it
reminds
me
of
the
violets
in
the
garden
of
my
aunt
magdalena
yes
then
i
was
a
little
wild
boy
who
did
not
go
to
school
very
regularly
o
heavens
‘tis
a
long
time
since
i
have
thought
on
those
times
the
good
old
soul
she
lived
behind
the
exchange
she
always
had
a
few
twigs
or
green
shoots
in
water—let
the
winter
rage
without
as
it
might
the
violets
exhaled
their
sweet
breath
whilst
i
pressed
against
the
windowpanes
covered
with
fantastic
frost-work
the
copper
coin
i
had
heated
on
the
stove
and
so
made
peep-holes
what
splendid
vistas
were
then
opened
to
my
view
what
change—what
magnificence
yonder
in
the
canal
lay
the
ships
frozen
up
and
deserted
by
their
whole
crews
with
a
screaming
crow
for
the
sole
occupant
but
when
the
spring
with
a
gentle
stirring
motion
announced
her
arrival
a
new
and
busy
life
arose
with
songs
and
hurrahs
the
ice
was
sawn
asunder
the
ships
were
fresh
tarred
and
rigged
that
they
might
sail
away
to
distant
lands
but
i
have
remained
here—must
always
remain
here
sitting
at
my
desk
in
the
office
and
patiently
see
other
people
fetch
their
passports
to
go
abroad
such
is
my
fate
alas!”—sighed
he
and
was
again
silent
great
heaven
what
is
come
to
me
never
have
i
thought
or
felt
like
this
before
it
must
be
the

air
that
affects
me
with
feelings
almost
as
disquieting
as
they
are
refreshing

felt
in
his

for
the
papers
these
police-reports

soon
stem
the
torrent
of
my
ideas

effectually
hinder
any
rebellious
overflowing

did
i
get
all
this
rubbish
some
one
must
have
slipped
it
slyly
into
my
pocket
for
a
joke
there
is
too
a
letter
to
me
a
crumpled
letter
and
the
seal
broken
yes
it
was
not
a
very
polite
epistle
from
the
manager
of
a
theatre
in
which
both
pieces
were
flatly
refused
hem
hem
said
the
clerk
breathlessly
and
quite
exhausted
he
seated
himself
on
a
bank
his
thoughts
were
so
elastic
his
heart
so
tender
and
involuntarily
he
picked
one
of
the
nearest
flowers
it
is
a
simple
daisy
just
bursting
out
of
the
bud
what
the
botanist
tells
us
after
a
number
of
imperfect
lectures
the
flower
proclaimed
in
a
minute
it
related
the
mythus
of
its
birth
told
of
the
power
of
the
sun-light
that
spread
out
its
delicate
leaves
and
forced
them
to
impregnate
the
air
with
their
incense—and
then
he
thought
of
the
manifold
struggles
of
life
which
in
like
manner

the
budding
flowers
of
feeling
in
our
bosom
light
and
air
contend
with
chivalric
emulation
for
the
love
of
the
fair
flower
that
bestowed
her
chief
favors
on
the
latter
full
of
longing
she
turned
towards
the
light
and
as
soon
as
it
vanished
rolled
her
tender
leaves
together
and
slept
in
the
embraces
of
the
air
it
is
the
light
which
adorns
me
said
the
flower
but
‘tis
the
air
which
enables
thee
to
breathe
said
the
poet’s
voice
close
by
stood
a
boy
who
dashed
his
stick
into
a
wet
ditch
the
drops
of
water
splashed
up
to
the
green
leafy
roof
and
the
clerk
thought
of
the
million
of
ephemera
which
in
a
single
drop
were
thrown
up
to
a
height
that
was
as
great
doubtless
for
their
size
as
for
us
if
we
were
to
be
hurled
above
the
clouds
while
he
thought
of
this
and
of
the
whole
metamorphosis
he
had
undergone
he
smiled
and
said
i
sleep
and
dream
but
it
is
wonderful
how
one
can
dream
so
naturally
and
know
besides
so
exactly
that
it
is
but
a
dream
if
only
to-morrow
on
awaking
i
could
again
call
all
to
mind
so
vividly
i
seem
in
unusually
good
spirits
my
perception
of
things
is
clear
i
feel
as
light
and
cheerful
as
though
i
were
in
heaven
but
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
if
to-morrow
a
dim
remembrance
of
it
should
swim
before
my
mind
it
will
then
seem
nothing
but
stupid
nonsense
as
i
have
often
experienced
already—especially
before
i
enlisted
under
the
banner
of
the
police
for
that
dispels
like
a
whirlwind
all
the
visions
of
an
unfettered
imagination
all
we
hear
or
say
in
a
dream
that
is
fair
and
beautiful
is
like
the
gold
of
the
subterranean
spirits
it
is
rich
and
splendid
when
it
is
given
us
but
viewed
by
daylight
we
find
only
withered
leaves
alas
he
sighed
quite
sorrowful
and
gazed
at
the
chirping
birds
that
hopped
contentedly
from
branch
to
branch
they
are
much
better
off
than
i
to
fly
must
be
a
heavenly
art
and
happy
do
i
prize
that
creature
in
which
it
is
innate
yes
could
i
exchange
my
nature
with
any
other
creature
i
fain
would
be
such
a
happy
little
lark
he
had
hardly
uttered
these
hasty
words
when
the
skirts
and
sleeves
of
his
coat
folded
themselves
together
into
wings
the
clothes
became
feathers
and
the
galoshes
claws
he
observed
it
perfectly
and
laughed
in
his
heart
now
then
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
am
dreaming
but
i
never
before
was
aware
of
such
mad
freaks
as
these
and
up
he
flew
into
the
green
roof
and
sang
but
in
the
song
there
was
no
poetry
for
the
spirit
of
the
poet
was
gone
the
shoes
as
is
the
case
with
anybody
who
does
what
he
has
to
do
properly
could
only
attend
to
one
thing
at
a
time
he
wanted
to
be
a
poet
and
he
was
one
he
now
wished
to
be
a
merry
chirping
bird
but
when
he
was
metamorphosed
into
one
the
former
peculiarities
ceased
immediately
it
is
really
pleasant
enough
said
he
the
whole
day
long
i
sit
in
the
office
amid
the
driest
law-papers
and
at
night
i
fly
in
my
dream
as
a
lark
in
the
gardens
of
fredericksburg
one
might
really
write
a
very
pretty
comedy
upon
it
he
now
fluttered
down
into
the
grass
turned
his
head
gracefully
on
every
side
and
with
his
bill
pecked
the
pliant
blades
of
grass
which
in
comparison
to
his
present
size
seemed
as
majestic
as
the
palm-branches
of
northern
africa
unfortunately
the
pleasure
lasted
but
a
moment
presently
black
night
overshadowed
our
enthusiast
who
had
so
entirely
missed
his
part
of
copying-clerk
at
a
police-office
some
vast
object
seemed
to
be
thrown
over
him
it
was
a
large
oil-skin
cap
which
a
sailor-boy
of
the
quay
had
thrown
over
the
struggling
bird
a
coarse
hand
sought
its
way
carefully
in
under
the
broad
rim
and
seized
the
clerk
over
the
back
and
wings
in
the
first
moment
of
fear
he
called
indeed
as
loud
as
he
could—“you
impudent
little
blackguard
i
am
a
copying-clerk
at
the
police-office
and
you
know
you
cannot
insult
any
belonging
to
the
constabulary
force
without
a
chastisement
besides
you
good-for
nothing
rascal
it
is
strictly
forbidden
to
catch
birds
in
the
royal
gardens
of
fredericksburg
but
your
blue
uniform
betrays
where
you
come
from
this
fine
tirade
sounded
however
to
the
ungodly
sailor-boy
like
a
mere
pippi-pi
he
gave
the
noisy
bird
a
knock
on
his
beak
and
walked
on
he
was
soon
met
by
two
schoolboys
of
the
upper
class—that
is
to
say
as
individuals
for
with
classic
fairy
tales

regard
to
learning
they
were
in
the
lowest
class
in
the
school
and
they
bought
the
stupid
bird
so
the
copying-clerk
came
to
copenhagen
as
guest
or
rather
as
prisoner
in
a
family
living
in
gother
street
‘tis
well
that
i’m
dreaming
said
the
clerk
or
i
really
should
get
angry
first
i
was
a
poet
now
sold
for
a
few
pence
as
a
lark
no
doubt
it
was
that
accursed
poetical
nature
which
has
metamorphosed
me
into
such
a
poor
harmless
little
creature
it
is
really
pitiable
particularly
when
one
gets
into
the
hands
of
a
little
blackguard
perfect
in
all
sorts
of
cruelty
to
animals
all
i
should
like
to
know
is
how
the
story
will
end
the
two
schoolboys
the
proprietors
now
of
the
transformed
clerk
carried
him
into
an
elegant
room
a
stout
stately
dame
received
them
with
a
smile
but
she
expressed
much
dissatisfaction
that
a
common
field-bird
as
she
called
the
lark
should
appear
in
such
high
society
for
to-day
however
she
would
allow
it
and
they
must
shut
him
in
the
empty
cage
that
was
standing
in
the
window
perhaps
he
will
amuse
my
good
polly
added
the
lady
looking
with
a
benignant
smile
at
a
large
green
parrot
that
swung
himself
backwards
and
forwards
most
comfortably
in
his
ring
inside
a
magnificent
brass-wired
cage
to-day
is
polly’s
birthday
said
she
with
stupid
simplicity
and
the
little
brown
field-bird
must
wish
him
joy
mr
polly
uttered
not
a
syllable
in
reply
but
swung
to
and
fro
with
dignified
condescension
while
a
pretty
canary
as
yellow
as
gold
that
had
lately
been
brought
from
his
sunny
fragrant
home
began
to
sing
aloud
noisy
creature
will
you
be
quiet
screamed
the
lady
of
the
house
covering
the
cage
with
an
embroidered
white
pocket
handkerchief
chirp
chirp
sighed
he
that
was
a
dreadful
snowstorm
and
he
sighed
again
and
was
silent
the
copying-clerk
or
as
the
lady
said
the
brown
field-bird
was
put
into
a
small
cage
close
to
the
canary
and
not
far
from
my
good
polly
the
only
human
sounds
that
the
parrot
could
bawl
out
were
come
let
us
be
men
everything
else
that
he
said
was
as
unintelligible
to
everybody
as
the
chirping
of
the
canary
except
to
the
clerk
who
was
now
a
bird
too
he
understood
his
companion
perfectly
i
flew
about
beneath
the
green
palms
and
the
blossoming
almond-trees
sang
the
canary
i
flew
around
with
my
brothers
and
sisters
over
the
beautiful
flowers
and
over
the
glassy
lakes
where
the
bright
water-plants
nodded
to
me
from
below
there
too
i
saw
many
splendidly-dressed
paroquets
that
told
the
drollest
stories
and
the
wildest
fairy
tales
without
end
oh
those
were
uncouth
birds
answered
the
parrot
they
had
no
education
and
talked
of
whatever
came
into
their
head
if
my
mistress
and
all
her
friends
can
laugh
at
what
i
say
so
may
you
too
i
should
think
it
is
a
great
fault
to
have
no
taste
for
what
is
witty
or
amusing—come
let
us
be
men
ah
you
have
no
remembrance
of
love
for
the
charming
maidens
that
danced
beneath
the
outspread
tents
beside
the
bright
fragrant
flowers
do
you
no
longer
remember
the
sweet
fruits
and
the
cooling
juice
in
the
wild
plants
of
our
never-to-be-forgotten
home
said
the
former
inhabitant
of
the
canary
isles
continuing
his
dithyrambic
oh
yes
said
the
parrot
but
i
am
far
better
off
here
i
am
well
fed
and
get
friendly
treatment
i
know
i
am
a
clever
fellow
and
that
is
all
i
care
about
come
let
us
be
men
you
are
of
a
poetical
nature
as
it
is
called—i
on
the
contrary
possess
profound
knowledge
and
inexhaustible
wit
you
have
genius
but
clear-sighted

not

natural
tones
for
this
they
have
covered
you
over—they
never
do
the
like
to
me
for
i
cost
more
besides
they
are
afraid
of
my
beak
and
i
have
always
a
witty
answer
at
hand
come
let
us
be
men
o
warm
spicy
land
of
my
birth
sang
the
canary
bird
i
will
sing
of
thy
dark-green
bowers
of
the
calm
bays
where
the
pendent
boughs
kiss
the
surface
of
the
water
i
will
sing
of
the
rejoicing
of
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
where
the
cactus
grows
in
wanton
luxuriance
spare
us
your
elegiac
tones
said
the
parrot
giggling
rather
speak
of
something
at
which
one
may
laugh
heartily
laughing
is
an
infallible
sign
of
the
highest
degree
of
mental
development
can
a
dog
or
a
horse
laugh
no
but
they
can
cry
the
gift
of
laughing
was
given
to
man
alone

screamed
polly
and
added
his
stereotype
witticism
come
let
us
be
men
poor
little
danish
grey-bird
said
the
canary
you
have
been
caught
too
it
is
no
doubt
cold
enough
in
your
woods
but
there
at
least
is
the
breath
of
liberty
therefore
fly
away
in
the
hurry
they
have
forgotten
to
shut
your
cage
and
the
upper
window
is
open
fly
my
friend
fly
away
farewell
instinctively
the
clerk
obeyed
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
wings
he
was
out
of
the
cage
but
at
the
same
moment
the
door
which
was
only
ajar
and
which
led
to
the
next
room
began
to
creak
and
supple
and
creeping
came
the
large
tomcat
into
the
room
and
began
to
pursue
him
the
frightened
canary
fluttered
about
in
his
cage
the
parrot
flapped
his
wings
and
cried
come
let
us
be
men
the
clerk
felt
a
mortal
fright
and
flew
through
the
window
far
away
over
the
houses
and
streets
at
last
he
was
forced
to
rest
a
little
the
neighboring
house
had
a
something
familiar
about
it
a
window
stood
open
he
flew
in
it
was
his
own
room
he
perched
upon
the
table
come
let
us
be
men
said
he
involuntarily
imitating
the
chatter
of
the
parrot
and
at
the
same
moment
he
was
again
a
copying-clerk
but
he
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
table
heaven
help
me
cried
he
how
did
i
get
up
here—and
so
buried
in
sleep
too
after
all
that
was
a
very
unpleasant
disagreeable
dream
that
haunted
me
the
whole
story
is
nothing
but
silly
stupid
nonsense
vi
the
best
that
the
galoshes
gave
the
following
day
early
in
the
morning
while
the
clerk
was
still
in
bed
someone
knocked
at
his
door
it
was
his
neighbor
a
young
divine
who
lived
on
the
same
floor
he
walked
in
lend
me
your
galoshes
said
he
it
is
so
wet
in
the
garden
though
the
sun
is
shining
most
invitingly
i
should
like
to
go
out
a
little
he
got
the
galoshes
and
he
was
soon
below
in
a
little
duodecimo
garden
where
between
two
immense
walls
a
plumtree
and
an
apple-tree
were
standing
even
such
a
little
garden
as
this
was
considered
in
the
metropolis
of
copenhagen
as
a
great
luxury
the
young
man
wandered
up
and
down
the
narrow
paths
as
well
as
the
prescribed
limits
would
allow
the
clock
struck
six
without
was
heard
the
horn
of
a
post-boy
to
travel
to
travel
exclaimed
he
overcome
by
most
painful
and
passionate
remembrances
that
is
the
happiest
thing
in
the
world
that
is
the
highest
aim
of
all
my
wishes
then
at
last
would
the
agonizing
restlessness
be
allayed
which
destroys
my
existence
but
it
must
be
far
far
away
i
would
behold

it
was
a
good
thing
that
the
power
of
the
galoshes
worked
as
instantaneously
as
lightning
in
a
powder-magazine
would
do
otherwise
the
poor
man
with
his
overstrained
wishes
would
have
travelled
about
the
world
too
much
for
himself
as
well
as
for
us
in
short
he
was
travelling
he
was
in
the
middle
of
switzerland
but
packed
up
with
eight
other
passengers
in
the
inside
of
an
eternally
creaking
diligence
his
head
ached
till
it
almost
split
his
weary
neck
could
hardly
bear
the
heavy
load
and
his
feet
pinched
by
his
torturing
boots
were
terribly
swollen
he
was
in
an
intermediate
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
at
variance
with
himself
with
his
company
with
the
country
and
with
the
government
in
his
right
pocket
he
had
his
letter
of
credit
in
the
left
his
passport
and
in
a
small
leathern
purse
some
double
louis
d’or
carefully
sewn
up
in
the
bosom
of
his
waistcoat
every
dream
proclaimed
that
one
or
the
other
of
these
valuables
was
lost
wherefore
he
started
up
as
in
a
fever
and
the
first
movement
which
his
hand
made
described
a
magic
triangle
from
the
right
pocket
to
the
left
and
then
up
towards
the
bosom
to
feel
if
he
had
them
all
safe
or
not
from
the
roof
inside
the
carriage
umbrellas
walking-sticks
hats
and
sundry
other
articles
were
depending
and
hindered
the
view
which
was
particularly
imposing
he
now
endeavored
as
well
as
he
was
able
to
dispel
his
gloom
which
was
caused
by
outward
chance
circumstances
merely
and
on
the
bosom
of
nature
imbibe
the
milk
of
purest
human
enjoyment
grand
solemn
and
dark
was
the
whole
landscape
around
the
gigantic
pine-forests
on
the
pointed
crags
seemed
almost
like
little
tufts
of
heather
colored
by
the
surrounding
clouds
it
began
to
snow
a
cold
wind
blew
and
roared
as
though
it
were
seeking
a
bride
augh
sighed
he
were
we
only
on
the
other
side
the
alps
then
we
should
have
summer
and
i
could
get
my
letters
of

cashed
the
anxiety
i
feel
about
them
prevents

were

the
fir
tree
out
in
the
woods
stood
a
nice
little
fir
tree
the
place
he
had
was
a
very
good
one
the
sun
shone
on
him
as
to
fresh
air
there
was
enough
of
that
and
round
him
grew
many
large-sized
comrades
pines
as
well
as
firs
but
the
little
fir
wanted
so
very
much
to
be
a
grown-up
tree
he
did
not
think
of
the
warm
sun
and
of
the
fresh
air
he
did
not
care
for
the
little
cottage
children
that
ran
about
and
prattled
when
they
were
in
the
woods
looking
for
wild-strawberries
the
children
often
came
with
a
whole
pitcher
full
of
berries
or
a
long
row
of
them
threaded
on
a
straw
and
sat
down
near
the
young
tree
and
said
oh
how
pretty
he
is
what
a
nice
little
fir
but
this
was
what
the
tree
could
not
bear
to
hear
at
the
end
of
a
year
he
had
shot
up
a
good
deal
and
after
another
year
he
was
another
long
bit
taller
for
with
fir
trees
one
can
always
tell
by
the
shoots
how
many
years
old
they
are
oh
were
i
but
such
a
high
tree
as
the
others
are
sighed
he
then
i
should
be
able
to
spread
out
my
branches
and
with
the
tops
to
look
into
the
wide
world
then
would
the
birds
build
nests
among
my
branches
and
when
there
was
a
breeze
i
could
bend
with
as
much
stateliness
as
the
others
neither
the
sunbeams
nor
the
birds
nor
the
red
clouds
which
morning
and
evening
sailed
above
him
gave
the
little
tree
any
pleasure
in
winter
when
the
snow
lay
glittering
on
the
ground
a
hare
would
often
come
leaping
along
and
jump
right
over
the
little
tree
oh
that
made
him
so
angry
but
two
winters
were
past
and
in
the
third
the
tree
was
so
large
that
the
hare
was
obliged
to
go
round
it
to
grow
and
grow
to
get
older
and
be
tall
thought
the
tree—“that
after
all
is
the
most
delightful
thing
in
the
world
in
autumn
the
wood-cutters
always
came
and
felled
some
of
the
largest
trees
this
happened
every
year
and
the
young
fir
tree
that
had
now
grown
to
a
very
comely
size
trembled
at
the
sight
for
the
magnificent
great
trees
fell
to
the
earth
with
noise
and
cracking
the
branches
were
lopped
off
and
the
trees
looked
long
and
bare
they
were
hardly
to
be
recognised
and
then
they
were
laid
in
carts
and
the
horses
dragged
them
out
of
the
wood
where
did
they
go
to
what
became
of
them
in
spring
when
the
swallows
and
the
storks
came
the
tree
asked
them
don’t
you
know
where
they
have
been
taken
have
you
not
met
them
anywhere
the
swallows
did
not
know
anything
about
it
but
the
stork
looked
musing
nodded
his
head
and
said
yes
i
think
i
know
i
met
many
ships
as
i
was
flying
hither
from
egypt
on
the
ships
were
magnificent
masts
and
i
venture
to
assert
that
it
was
they
that
smelt
so
of
fir
i
may
congratulate
you
for
they
lifted
themselves
on
high
most
majestically
oh
were
i
but
old
enough
to
fly
across
the
sea
but
how
does
the
sea
look
in
reality
what
is
it
like
that
would
take
a
long
time
to
explain
said
the
stork
and
with
these
words
off
he
went
rejoice
in
thy
growth
said
the
sunbeams
rejoice
in
thy
vigorous
growth
and
in
the
fresh
life
that
moveth
within
thee
and
the
wind
kissed
the
tree
and
the
dew
wept
tears
over
him

the

not

of
the

age
as
this
fir
tree
who
could
never
rest
but
always
wanted
to
be
off
these
young
trees
and
they
were
always
the
finest
looking

their
branches
they
were
laid
on

and
the
horses
drew
them
out
of
the

where
are
they
going

the

they
are

i
there
was

indeed

was

through

planted

of

ornamented
with
the
most

things
with
gilded
apples
with

with

then
asked

trembling
in

bough
and
then
what
happens
then
we
did
not
see
anything
more
it
was
incomparably
beautiful
i
would
fain
know
if
i
am

for
so
glorious
a
career

tree

that
is
still
better
than
to
cross

suffer

come
i
am
now
tall

were

off

oh
were
i
but
already
on

were
i
in

something

surely
follow

and
the
sunlight
rejoice
in
thy
own

but
the
tree
did
not
rejoice
at
all
he
grew
and
grew
and
was
green
both
winter
and
summer
people
that
saw
him
said
what
a
fine
tree
and
towards
christmas
he
was
one
of
the
first
that
was
cut
down
the
axe
struck
deep
into
the
very
pith
the
tree
fell
to
the
earth
with
a
sigh
he
felt
a
pang
it
was
like
a
swoon
he
could
not
think
of
happiness
for
he
was
sorrowful
at
being
separated
from
his
home
from
the
place
where
he
had
sprung
up
he
well
knew
that
he
should
never
see
his

little
bushes
and
flowers
around
him
anymore

not

departure
was

only
came
to
himself
when
he
was
unloaded
in

court-yard
with
the
other
trees
and
heard
a
man
say
that
one
is
splendid
we
don’t
want
the
others
then
two
servants
came
in
rich
livery
and
carried
the

into

large
and

were
hanging
on
the

and
near
the

stood
two

there

were

full
of

hundreds
of

so
and
the

was
stuck
upright
in
a
cask
that
was
filled
with
sand
but
no
one
could
see
that
it
was
a
cask
for
green
cloth
was
hung
all
round
it
and
it
stood
on
a

gaily-colored
carpet
oh
how
the

quivered
what
was
to
happen
the
servants
as
well
as
the

decorated
it
on

there
hung

net
was
filled
with

dolls
that

never
beheld

before—were
seen
among

at
the

a

he

that

of

set

to
the

it
blazed
up

cried
the

ladies
and
they
quickly
put

fire
now
the
tree
did
not

what
a
state
he
was
in
he
was
so
uneasy

he
should
lose
something
of

he
was

bewildered

opened

in

the
little
ones
stood
quite
still
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
then
they
shouted
that
the
whole
place
re-echoed
with
their
rejoicing
they
danced
round
the
tree
and
one
present
after
the
other
was
pulled
off
what
are
they
about
thought
the
tree
what
is
to
happen
now
and
the
lights
burned
down
to
the
very
branches
and
as
they
burned
down
they
were
put
out
one
after
the
other
and
then
the
children
had
permission
to
plunder
the
tree
so
they
fell
upon
it
with
such
violence
that
all
its
branches
cracked
if
it
had
not
been
fixed
firmly
in
the
ground
it
would
certainly
have
tumbled
down
the
children
danced
about
with
their
beautiful
playthings
no
one
looked
at
the
tree
except
the
old
nurse
who
peeped
between
the
branches
but
it
was
only
to
see
if
there
was
a
fig
or
an
apple
left
that
had
been
forgotten
a
story
a
story
cried
the
children
drawing
a
little
fat
man
towards
the
tree
he
seated
himself
under
it
and
said
now
we
are
in
the
shade
and
the
tree
can
listen
too
but
i
shall
tell
only
one
story
now
which
will
you
have
that
about
ivedy-avedy
or
about
humpy-dumpy
who
tumbled
downstairs
and
yet
after
all
came
to
the
throne
and
married
the
princess
ivedy-avedy
cried
some
humpy-dumpy
cried
the
others
there
was
such
a
bawling
and
screaming—the
fir
tree
alone
was
silent
and
he
thought
to
himself
am
i
not
to
bawl
with
the
rest
am
i
to
do
nothing
whatever
for
he
was
one
of
the
company
and
had
done
what
he
had
to
do
and
the
man
told
about
humpy-dumpy
that
tumbled
down
who
notwithstanding
came
to
the
throne
and
at
last
married
the
princess
and
the
children
clapped
their
hands
and
cried
oh
go
on
do
go
on
they
wanted
to
hear
about
ivedy-avedy
too
but
the
little
man
only
told
them
about
humpy-dumpy
the
fir
tree
stood
quite
still
and
absorbed
in
thought
the
birds
in
the
wood
had
never
related
the
like
of
this
humpy-dumpy
fell
downstairs
and
yet
he
married
the
princess
yes
yes
that’s
the
way
of
the
world
thought
the
fir
tree
and
believed
it
all
because
the
man
who
told
the
story
was
so
good-looking
well
well
who
knows
perhaps
i
may
fall
downstairs
too
and
get
a
princess
as
wife
and
he
looked
forward
with
joy
to
the
morrow
when
he
hoped
to
be
decked
out
again
with
lights
playthings
fruits
and
tinsel
i
won’t
tremble
to-morrow
thought
the
fir
tree
i
will
enjoy
to
the
full
all
my
splendor
to
morrow
i
shall
hear
again
the
story
of
humpy-dumpy
and
perhaps
that
of
ivedy-avedy
too
and
the
whole
night
the
tree
stood
still
and
in
deep
thought
in
the
morning
the
servant
and
the
housemaid
came
in
now
then
the
splendor
will
begin
again
thought
the
fir
but
they
dragged
him

and
up
the
stairs
into
the
loft
and
here
in
a
dark
corner
where
no
daylight
could
enter
they
left
him
what’s
the
meaning
of
this
thought
the
tree
what
am
i
to
do
here
what
shall
i
hear
now
i
wonder
and
he
leaned
against
the
wall
lost
in
reverie
time
enough
had
he
too
for
his
reflections
for
days
and
nights
passed
on
and
nobody
came
up
and
when
at
last
somebody
did
come
it
was
only
to
put
some
great
trunks
in
a
corner
out
of
the
way
there
stood
the
tree
quite
hidden
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
entirely
forgotten
‘tis
now
winter
out-of-doors
thought
the
tree
the
earth
is
hard
and
covered
with
snow
men
cannot
plant
me
now
and
therefore
i
have
been
put
up
here
under
shelter
till
the
spring-time
comes
how
thoughtful
that
is
how
kind
man
is
after
all
if
it
only
were
not
so
dark
here
and
so
terribly
lonely
not
even
a
hare
and
out
in
the
woods
it
was
so
pleasant
when
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
the
hare
leaped
by
yes—even
when
he
jumped
over
me
but
i
did
not
like
it
then
it
is
really
terribly
lonely
here
squeak
squeak
said
a
little
mouse
at
the
same
moment
peeping
out
of
his
hole
and
then
another
little
one
came
they
snuffed
about
the
fir
tree
and
rustled
among
the
branches
it
is
dreadfully
cold
said
the
mouse
but
for
that
it
would
be
delightful
here
old
fir
wouldn’t
it
i
am
by
no
means
old
said
the
fir
tree
there’s
many
a
one
considerably
older
than
i
am
where
do
you
come
from
asked
the
mice
and
what
can
you
do
they
were
so
extremely
curious
tell
us
about
the
most
beautiful
spot
on
the
earth
have
you
never
been
there
were
you
never
in
the
larder
where
cheeses
lie
on
the
shelves
and
hams
hang
from
above
where
one
dances
about
on
tallow
candles
that
place
where
one
enters
lean
and
comes
out
again
fat
and
portly
i
know
no
such
place
said
the
tree
but
i
know
the
wood
where
the
sun
shines
and
where
the
little
birds
sing
and
then
he
told
all
about
his
youth
and
the
little
mice
had
never
heard
the
like
before
and
they
listened
and
said
well
to
be
sure
how
much
you
have
seen
how
happy
you
must
have
been
i
said
the
fir
tree
thinking
over
what
he
had
himself
related
yes
in
reality
those
were
happy
times
and
then
he
told
about
christmas-eve
when
he
was
decked
out
with
cakes
and
candles
oh
said
the
little
mice
how
fortunate
you
have
been
old
fir
tree
i
am
by
no
means
old
said
he
i
came
from
the
wood
this
winter
i
am
in
my
prime
and
am
only
rather
short
for
my
age
what
delightful
stories
you
know
said
the
mice
and
the
next
night
they
came
with
four
other
little
mice
who
were
to
hear
what
the
tree
recounted
and
the
more
he
related
the
more
he
remembered
himself
and
it
appeared
as
if
those
times
had
really
been
happy
times
but
they
may
still
come—they
may
still
come
humpy-dumpy
fell
downstairs
and
yet
he
got
a
princess
and
he
thought
at
the
moment
of
a
nice
little
birch
tree
growing
out
in
the
woods
to
the
fir
that
would
be
a
real
charming
princess
who
is
humpy-dumpy
asked
the
mice
so
then
the
fir
tree
told
the
whole
fairy
tale
for
he
could
remember
every
single
word
of
it
and
the
little
mice
jumped
for
joy
up
to
the
very
top
of
the
tree
next
night
two
more
mice
came
and
on
sunday
two
rats
even
but
they
said
the
stories
were
not
interesting
which
vexed
the
little
mice
and
they
too
now
began
to
think
them
not
so
very
amusing
either

know

only
that
one
answered
the
tree
i
heard
it
on
my
happiest
evening
but
i
did
not
then
know
how
happy
i
was
it
is
a
very
stupid
story
don’t
you
know
one
about
bacon
and
tallow
candles
can’t
you
tell
any
larder
stories
no
said
the
tree
then
good-bye
said
the
rats
and
they
went
home
at
last
the
little
mice
stayed
away
also
and
the
tree
sighed
after
all
it
was
very
pleasant
when
the
sleek
little
mice
sat
round
me
and
listened
to
what
i
told
them
now
that
too
is
over
but
i
will
take
good
care
to
enjoy
myself
when
i
am
brought
out
again
but
when
was
that
to
be
why
one
morning
there
came
a
quantity
of
people
and
set
to
work
in
the
loft
the
trunks
were
moved
the
tree
was
pulled
out
and
thrown—rather
hard
it
is
true—down
on
the
floor
but
a
man
drew
him
towards
the
stairs
where
the
daylight
shone
now
a
merry
life
will
begin
again
thought
the
tree
he
felt
the
fresh
air
the
first
sunbeam—and
now
he
was
out
in
the
courtyard
all
passed
so
quickly
there
was
so
much
going
on
around
him
the
tree
quite
forgot
to
look
to
himself
the
court
adjoined
a
garden
and
all
was
in
flower
the
roses
hung
so
fresh
and
odorous
over
the
balustrade
the
lindens
were
in
blossom
the
swallows
flew
by
and
said
quirre-vit
my
husband
is
come
but
it
was
not
the
fir
tree
that
they
meant
now
then
i
shall
really
enjoy
life
said
he
exultingly
and
spread
out
his
branches
but
alas
they
were
all
withered
and
yellow
it
was
in
a
corner
that
he
lay
among
weeds
and
nettles
the
golden
star
of
tinsel
was
still
on
the
top
of
the
tree
and
glittered
in
the
sunshine
in
the
court-yard
some
of
the
merry
children
were
playing
who
had
danced
at
christmas
round
the
fir
tree
and
were
so
glad
at
the
sight
of
him
one
of
the
youngest
ran
and
tore
off
the
golden
star
only
look
what
is
still
on
the
ugly
old
christmas
tree
said
he
trampling
on
the
branches
so
that
they
all
cracked
beneath
his
feet
and
the
tree
beheld
all
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
and
the
freshness
in
the
garden
he
beheld
himself
and
wished
he
had
remained
in
his
dark
corner
in
the
loft
he
thought
of
his
first
youth
in
the
wood
of
the
merry
christmas-eve
and
of
the
little
mice
who
had
listened
with
so
much
pleasure
to
the
story
of
humpy-dumpy
‘tis
over—‘tis
past
said
the
poor
tree
had
i
but
rejoiced
when
i
had
reason
to
do
so
but
now
‘tis
past
‘tis
past
and
the
gardener’s
boy
chopped
the
tree
into
small
pieces
there
was
a
whole
heap
lying
there
the
wood
flamed
up
splendidly
under
the
large
brewing
copper
and
it
sighed
so
deeply
each
sigh
was
like
a
shot
the
boys
played
about
in
the
court
and
the
youngest
wore
the
gold
star
on
his
breast
which
the
tree
had
had
on
the
happiest
evening
of
his
life
however
that
was
over
now—the
tree
gone
the
story
at
an
end

all
was
over—every

the
snow
queen
first
story
which
treats
of
a
mirror
and
of
the
splinters
now
then
let
us
begin
when
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
story
we
shall
know
more
than
we
know
now
but
to
begin
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
wicked
sprite
indeed
he
was
the
most
mischievous
of
all
sprites
one
day
he
was
in
a
very
good
humor
for
he
had
made
a
mirror
with
the
power
of
causing
all
that
was
good
and
beautiful
when
it
was
reflected
therein
to
look
poor
and
mean
but
that
which
was
good
for-nothing
and
looked
ugly
was
shown
magnified
and
increased
in
ugliness
in
this
mirror
the
most
beautiful
landscapes
looked
like
boiled
spinach
and
the
best
persons
were
turned
into
frights
or
appeared
to
stand
on
their
heads
their
faces
were
so
distorted
that
they
were
not
to
be
recognised
and
if
anyone
had
a
mole
you
might
be
sure
that
it
would
be
magnified
and
spread
over
both
nose
and
mouth
that’s
glorious
fun
said
the
sprite
if
a
good
thought
passed
through
a
man’s
mind
then
a
grin
was
seen
in
the
mirror
and
the
sprite
laughed
heartily
at
his
clever
discovery
all
the
little
sprites
who
went
to
his
school—for
he
kept
a
sprite
school—told
each
other
that
a
miracle
had
happened
and
that
now
only
as
they
thought
it
would
be
possible
to
see
how
the
world
really
looked
they
ran
about
with
the
mirror
and
at
last
there
was
not
a
land
or
a
person
who
was
not
represented
distorted
in
the
mirror
so
then
they
thought
they
would
fly
up
to
the
sky
and
have
a
joke
there
the
higher
they
flew
with
the
mirror
the
more
terribly
it
grinned
they
could
hardly
hold
it
fast
higher
and
higher
still
they
flew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
stars
when
suddenly
the
mirror
shook
so
terribly
with
grinning
that
it
flew
out
of
their
hands
and
fell
to
the
earth
where
it
was
dashed
in
a
hundred
million
and
more
pieces
and
now
it
worked
much
more
evil
than
before
for
some
of
these
pieces
were
hardly
so
large
as
a
grain
of
sand
and
they
flew
about
in
the
wide
world
and
when
they
got
into
people’s
eyes
there
they
stayed
and
then
people
saw
everything
perverted
or
only
had
an
eye
for
that
which
was
evil
this
happened
because
the
very
smallest
bit
had
the
same
power
which
the
whole
mirror
had
possessed
some
persons
even
got
a
splinter
in
their
heart
and
then
it
made
one
shudder
for
their
heart
became
like
a
lump
of
ice
some
of
the
broken
pieces
were
so
large
that
they
were
used
for
windowpanes
through
which
one
could
not
see
one’s
friends
other
pieces
were
put
in
spectacles
and
that
was
a
sad
affair
when
people
put
on
their
glasses
to
see
well
and
rightly
then
the
wicked
sprite
laughed
till
he
almost
choked
for
all
this
tickled
his
fancy
the
fine
splinters
still
flew
about
in
the
air
and
now
we
shall
hear
what
happened
next
second
story
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
in
a
large
town
where
there
are
so
many
houses
and
so
many
people
that
there
is
no
roof
left
for
everybody
to
have
a
little
garden
and
where
on
this
account
most
persons
are
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
flowers
in
pots
there
lived
two
little
children
who
had
a
garden
somewhat
larger
than
a
flower-pot
they
were
not
brother
and
sister
but
they
cared
for
each
other
as
much
as
if
they
were
their
parents
lived
exactly
opposite
they
inhabited
two
garrets
and
where
the
roof
of
the
one
house
joined
that
of
the
other
and
the
gutter
ran
along
the
extreme
end
of
it
there
was
to
each
house
a
small
window
one
needed
only
to
step
over
the
gutter
to
get
from
one
window
to
the
other
the
children’s
parents
had
large
wooden
boxes
there
in
which
vegetables
for
the
kitchen
were
planted
and
little
rosetrees
besides
there
was
a
rose
in
each
box
and
they
grew
splendidly
they
now
thought
of
placing
the
boxes
across
the
gutter
so
that
they
nearly
reached
from
one
window

the
other
and
looked
just
like
two
walls
of
flowers
the
tendrils
of
the
peas
hung
down
over
the
boxes
and
the
rose-trees
shot
up
long
branches
twined
round
the
windows
and
then
bent
towards
each
other
it
was
almost
like
a
triumphant
arch
of
foliage
and
flowers
the
boxes
were
very
high
and
the
children
knew
that
they
must
not
creep
over
them
so
they
often
obtained
permission
to
get
out
of
the
windows
to
each
other
and
to
sit
on
their
little
stools
among
the
roses
where
they
could
play
delightfully
in
winter
there
was
an
end
of
this
pleasure
the
windows
were
often
frozen
over
but
then
they
heated
copper
farthings
on
the
stove
and
laid
the
hot
farthing
on
the
windowpane
and
then
they
had
a
capital
peep-hole
quite
nicely
rounded
and
out
of
each
peeped
a
gentle
friendly
eye
it
was
the
little
boy
and
the
little
girl
who
were
looking
out
his
name
was
kay
hers
was
gerda
in
summer
with
one
jump
they
could
get
to
each
other
but
in
winter
they
were
obliged
first
to
go
down
the
long
stairs
and
then
up
the
long
stairs
again
and
out-of-doors
there
was
quite
a
snow
storm
it
is
the
white
bees
that
are
swarming
said
kay’s
old
grandmother
do
the
white
bees
choose
a
queen
asked
the
little
boy
for
he
knew
that
the
honey-bees
always
have
one
yes
said
the
grandmother
she
flies
where
the
swarm
hangs
in
the
thickest
clusters
she
is
the
largest
of
all
and
she
can
never
remain
quietly
on
the
earth
but
goes
up
again
into
the
black
clouds
many
a
winter’s
night
she
flies
through
the
streets
of
the
town
and
peeps
in
at
the
windows
and
they
then
freeze
in
so
wondrous
a
manner
that
they
look
like
flowers
yes
i
have
seen
it
said
both
the
children
and
so
they
knew
that
it
was
true
can
the
snow
queen
come
in
said
the
little
girl
only
let
her
come
in
said
the
little
boy
then
i’d
put
her
on
the
stove
and
she’d
melt
and
then
his
grandmother
patted
his
head
and
told
him
other
stories
in
the
evening
when
little
kay
was
at
home
and
half
undressed
he
climbed
up
on
the
chair
by
the
window
and
peeped
out
of
the
little
hole
a
few
snow-flakes
were
falling
and
one
the
largest
of
all
remained
lying
on
the
edge
of
a
flower-pot
the
flake
of
snow
grew
larger
and
larger
and
at
last
it
was
like
a
young
lady
dressed
in
the
finest
white
gauze
made
of
a
million
little
flakes
like
stars
she
was
so
beautiful
and
delicate
but
she
was
of
ice
of
dazzling
sparkling
ice
yet
she
lived
her
eyes
gazed
fixedly
like
two
stars
but
there
was
neither
quiet
nor
repose
in
them
she
nodded
towards
the
window
and
beckoned
with
her
hand
the
little
boy
was
frightened
and
jumped
down
from
the
chair
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
at
the
same
moment
a
large
bird
flew
past
the
window
the
next
day
it
was
a
sharp
frost—and
then
the
spring
came
the
sun
shone
the
green
leaves
appeared
the
swallows
built
their
nests
the
windows
were
opened
and
the
little
children
again
sat
in
their
pretty
garden
high
up
on
the
leads
at
the
top
of
the
house
that
summer
the
roses
flowered
in
unwonted
beauty
the
little
girl
had
learned
a
hymn
in
which
there
was
something
about
roses
and
then
she
thought
of
her
own
flowers
and
she
sang
the
verse
to
the
little
boy
who
then
sang
it
with
her
the
rose
in
the
valley
is
blooming
so
sweet
and
angels
descend
there
the
children
to
greet
and
the
children
held
each
other
by
the
hand
kissed
the
roses
looked
up
at
the
clear
sunshine
and
spoke
as
though
they
really
saw
angels
there
what
lovely
summer-days
those
were

to
be
out
in
the
air
near
the
fresh
rose-bushes
that
seem
as
if
they
would
never
finish
blossoming
kay
and
gerda
looked
at
the
picture-book
full
of
beasts
and
of
birds
and
it
was
then—the
clock
in
the
church-tower
was
just
striking
five—that
kay
said
oh
i
feel
such
a
sharp
pain
in
my
heart
and
now
something
has
got
into
my
eye
the
little
girl
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
he
winked
his
eyes
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
i
think
it
is
out
now
said
he
but
it
was
not
it
was
just
one
of
those
pieces
of
glass
from
the
magic
mirror
that
had
got
into
his
eye
and
poor
kay
had
got
another
piece
right
in
his
heart
it
will
soon
become
like
ice
it
did
not
hurt
any
longer
but
there
it
was
what
are
you
crying
for
asked
he
you
look
so
ugly
there’s
nothing
the
matter
with
me
ah
said
he
at
once
that
rose
is
cankered
and
look
this
one
is
quite
crooked
after
all
these
roses
are
very
ugly
they
are
just
like
the
box
they
are
planted
in
and
then
he
gave
the
box
a
good
kick
with
his
foot
and
pulled
both
the
roses
up
what
are
you
doing
cried
the
little
girl
and
as
he
perceived
her
fright
he
pulled
up
another
rose
got
in
at
the
window
and
hastened
off
from
dear
little
gerda
afterwards
when
she
brought
her
picture-book
he
asked
what
horrid
beasts
have
you
there
and
if
his
grandmother
told
them
stories
he
always
interrupted
her
besides
if
he
could
manage
it
he
would
get
behind
her
put
on
her
spectacles
and
imitate
her
way
of
speaking
he
copied
all
her
ways
and
then
everybody
laughed
at
him
he
was
soon
able
to
imitate
the
gait
and
manner
of
everyone
in
the
street
everything
that
was
peculiar
and
displeasing
in
them—that
kay
knew
how
to
imitate
and
at
such
times
all
the
people
said
the
boy
is
certainly
very
clever
but
it
was
the
glass
he
had
got
in
his
eye
the
glass
that
was
sticking
in
his
heart
which
made
him
tease
even
little
gerda
whose
whole
soul
was
devoted
to
him
his
games
now
were
quite
different
to
what
they
had
formerly
been
they
were
so
very
knowing
one
winter’s
day
when
the
flakes
of
snow
were
flying
about
he
spread
the
skirts
of
his
blue
coat
and
caught
the
snow
as
it
fell
look
through
this
glass
gerda
said
he
and
every
flake
seemed
larger
and
appeared
like
a
magnificent
flower
or
beautiful
star
it
was
splendid
to
look
at
look
how
clever
said
kay
that’s
much
more
interesting
than
real
flowers
they
are
as
exact
as
possible
there
is
not
a
fault
in
them
if
they
did
not
melt
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
kay
came
one
day
with
large
gloves
on
and
his
little
sledge
at
his
back
and
bawled
right
into
gerda’s
ears
i
have
permission
to
go
out
into
the
square
where
the
others
are
playing
and
off
he
was
in
a
moment
there
in
the
market-place
some
of
the
boldest
of
the
boys
used
to
tie
their
sledges
to
the
carts
as
they
passed
by
and
so
they
were
pulled
along
and
got
a
good
ride
it
was
so
capital
just
as
they
were
in
the
very
height
of
their
amusement
a
large
sledge
passed
by
it
was
painted
quite
white
and
there
was
someone
in
it
wrapped
up
in
a
rough
white
mantle
of
fur
with
a
rough
white
fur
cap
on
his
head
the
sledge
drove
round
the
square
twice
and
kay
tied
on
his
sledge
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
off
he
drove
with
it
on
they
went
quicker
and
quicker
into
the
next
street
and
the
person
who
drove
turned
round
to
kay
and
nodded
to
him
in
a
friendly
manner
just
as
if
they
knew
each
other
every
time
he
was
going
to
untie
his
sledge
the
person
nodded
to
him
and
then
kay
sat
quiet
and
so
on
they
went
till
they
came
outside
the
gates
of
the
town
then
the
snow
began
to
fall
so
thickly
that
the
little
boy
could
not
see
an
arm’s
length
before
him
but
still
on
he
went
when
suddenly
he
let
go
the
string
he
held
in
his
hand
in
order
to
get
loose
from
the
sledge
but
it
was

no
use
still
the
little
vehicle
rushed
on
with
the
quickness
of
the
wind
he
then
cried
as
loud
as
he
could
but
no
one
heard
him
the
snow
drifted
and
the
sledge
flew
on
and
sometimes
it
gave
a
jerk
as
though
they
were
driving
over
hedges
and
ditches
he
was
quite
frightened
and
he
tried
to
repeat
the
lord’s
prayer
but
all
he
could
do
he
was
only
able
to
remember
the
multiplication
table
the
snow-flakes
grew
larger
and
larger
till
at
last
they
looked
just
like
great
white
fowls
suddenly
they
flew
on
one
side
the
large
sledge
stopped
and
the
person
who
drove
rose
up
it
was
a
lady
her
cloak
and
cap
were
of
snow
she
was
tall
and
of
slender
figure
and
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
it
was
the
snow
queen
we
have
travelled
fast
said
she
but
it
is
freezingly
cold
come
under
my
bearskin
and
she
put
him
in
the
sledge
beside
her
wrapped
the
fur
round
him
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
sinking
in
a
snow-wreath
are
you
still
cold
asked
she
and
then
she
kissed
his
forehead
ah
it
was
colder
than
ice
it
penetrated
to
his
very
heart
which
was
already
almost
a
frozen
lump
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
about
to
die—but
a
moment
more
and
it
was
quite
congenial
to
him
and
he
did
not
remark
the
cold
that
was
around
him
my
sledge
do
not
forget
my
sledge
it
was
the
first
thing
he
thought
of
it
was
there
tied
to
one
of
the
white
chickens
who
flew
along
with
it
on
his
back
behind
the
large
sledge
the
snow
queen
kissed
kay
once
more
and
then
he
forgot
little
gerda
grandmother
and
all
whom
he
had
left
at
his
home
now
you
will
have
no
more
kisses
said
she
or
else
i
should
kiss
you
to
death
kay
looked
at
her
she
was
very
beautiful
a
more
clever
or
a
more
lovely
countenance
he
could
not
fancy
to
himself
and
she
no
longer
appeared
of
ice
as
before
when
she
sat
outside
the
window
and
beckoned
to
him
in
his
eyes
she
was
perfect
he
did
not
fear
her
at
all
and
told
her
that
he
could
calculate
in
his
head
and
with
fractions
even
that
he
knew
the
number
of
square
miles
there
were
in
the
different
countries
and
how
many
inhabitants
they
contained
and
she
smiled
while
he
spoke
it
then
seemed
to
him
as
if
what
he
knew
was
not
enough
and
he
looked
upwards
in
the
large
huge
empty
space
above
him
and
on
she
flew
with
him
flew
high
over
the
black
clouds
while
the
storm
moaned
and
whistled
as
though
it
were
singing
some
old
tune
on
they
flew
over
woods
and
lakes
over
seas
and
many
lands
and
beneath
them
the
chilling
storm
rushed
fast
the
wolves
howled
the
snow
crackled
above
them
flew
large
screaming
crows
but
higher
up
appeared
the
moon
quite
large
and
bright
and
it
was
on
it
that
kay
gazed

the
long
long

that
i
don’t
believe
said
the
sunshine
kay
is
dead
and
gone
said
she
to
the
swallows
that
i
don’t
believe
said
they
and
at
last
little
gerda
did
not
think
so
any
longer
either
i’ll
put
on
my
red
shoes
said
she
one
morning
kay
has
never
seen
them
and
then
i’ll
go
down
to
the
river
and
ask
there
it
was
quite
early
she
kissed
her
old
grandmother
who
was
still
asleep
put
on
her
red
shoes
and
went
alone
to
the
river
is
it
true
that
you
have
taken
my
little
playfellow
i
will
make
you
a
present
of
my
red
shoes
if
you
will
give
him
back
to
me
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
the
blue
waves
nodded
in
a
strange
manner
then
she
took
off
her
red
shoes
the
most
precious
things
she
possessed
and
threw
them
both
into
the
river
but
they
fell
close
to
the
bank
and
the
little
waves
bore
them
immediately
to
land
it
was
as
if
the
stream
would
not
take
what
was
dearest
to
her
for
in
reality
it
had
not
got
little
kay
but
gerda
thought
that
she
had
not
thrown
the
shoes
out
far
enough
so
she
clambered
into
a
boat
which
lay
among
the
rushes
went
to
the
farthest
end
and
threw
out
the
shoes
but
the
boat
was
not
fastened
and
the
motion
which
she
occasioned
made
it
drift
from
the
shore
she
observed
this
and
hastened
to
get
back
but
before
she
could
do
so
the
boat
was
more
than
a
yard
from
the
land
and
was
gliding
quickly
onward
little
gerda
was
very
frightened
and
began
to
cry
but
no
one
heard
her
except
the
sparrows
and
they
could
not
carry
her
to
land
but
they
flew
along
the
bank
and
sang
as
if
to
comfort
her
here
we
are
here
we
are
the
boat
drifted
with
the
stream
little
gerda
sat
quite
still
without
shoes
for
they
were
swimming
behind
the
boat
but
she
could
not
reach
them
because
the
boat
went
much
faster
than
they
did
the
banks
on
both
sides
were
beautiful
lovely
flowers
venerable
trees
and
slopes
with
sheep
and
cows
but
not
a
human
being
was
to
be
seen
perhaps
the
river
will
carry
me
to
little
kay
said
she
and
then
she
grew
less
sad
she
rose
and
looked
for
many
hours
at
the
beautiful
green
banks
presently
she
sailed
by
a
large
cherry-orchard
where
was
a
little
cottage
with
curious
red
and
blue
windows
it
was
thatched
and
before
it
two
wooden
soldiers
stood
sentry
and
presented
arms
when
anyone
went
past
gerda
called
to
them
for
she
thought
they
were
alive
but
they
of
course
did
not
answer
she
came
close
to
them
for
the
stream
drifted
the
boat
quite
near
the
land
gerda
called
still
louder
and
an
old
woman
then
came
out
of
the
cottage
leaning
upon
a
crooked
stick
she
had
a
large
broad-brimmed
hat
on
painted
with
the
most
splendid
flowers
poor
little
child
said
the
old
woman
how
did
you
get
upon
the
large
rapid
river
to
be
driven
about
so
in
the
wide
world
and
then
the
old
woman
went
into
the
water
caught
hold
of
the
boat
with
her
crooked
stick
drew
it
to
the
bank
and
lifted
little
gerda
out
and
gerda
was
so
glad
to
be
on
dry
land
again
but
she
was
rather
afraid
of
the
strange
old
woman
but
come
and
tell
me
who
you
are
and
how
you
came
here
said
she
and
gerda
told
her
all
and
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
and
said
a-hem
a-hem
and
when
gerda
had
told
her
everything
and
asked
her
if
she
had
not
seen
little
kay
the
woman
answered
that
he
had
not
passed
there
but
he
no
doubt
would
come
and
she
told
her
not
to
be
cast
down
but
taste
her
cherries
and
look
at
her
flowers
which
were
finer
than
any

a
picture-book

which
could
tell
a
whole
story
she
then
took
gerda
by
the
hand
led
her
into
the
little
cottage
and
locked
the
door
the
windows
were
very
high
up
the
glass
was
red
blue
and
green
and
the
sunlight
shone
through
quite
wondrously
in
all
sorts
of
colors
on
the
table
stood
the
most
exquisite
cherries
and
gerda
ate
as
many
as
she
chose
for
she
had
permission
to
do
so
while
she
was
eating
the
old
woman
combed
her
hair
with
a
golden
comb
and
her
hair
curled
and
shone
with
a
lovely
golden
color
around
that
sweet
little
face
which
was
so
round
and
so
like
a
rose
i
have
often
longed
for
such
a
dear
little
girl
said
the
old
woman
now
you
shall
see
how
well
we
agree
together
and
while
she
combed
little
gerda’s
hair
the
child
forgot
her
foster-brother
kay
more
and
more
for
the
old
woman
understood
magic
but
she
was
no
evil
being
she
only
practised
witchcraft
a
little
for
her
own
private
amusement
and
now
she
wanted
very
much
to
keep
little
gerda
she
therefore
went
out
in
the
garden
stretched
out
her
crooked
stick
towards
the
rose
bushes
which
beautifully
as
they
were
blowing
all
sank
into
the
earth
and
no
one
could
tell
where
they
had
stood
the
old
woman
feared
that
if
gerda
should
see
the
roses
she
would
then
think
of
her
own
would
remember
little
kay
and
run
away
from
her
she
now
led
gerda
into
the
flower-garden
oh
what
odour
and
what
loveliness
was
there
every
flower
that
one
could
think
of
and
of
every
season
stood
there
in
fullest
bloom
no
picture-book
could
be
gayer
or
more
beautiful
gerda
jumped
for
joy
and
played
till
the
sun
set
behind
the
tall
cherry-tree
she
then
had
a
pretty
bed
with
a
red
silken
coverlet
filled
with
blue
violets
she
fell
asleep
and
had
as
pleasant
dreams
as
ever
a
queen
on
her
wedding-day
the
next
morning
she
went
to
play
with
the
flowers
in
the
warm
sunshine
and
thus
passed
away
a
day
gerda
knew
every
flower
and
numerous
as
they
were
it
still
seemed
to
gerda
that
one
was
wanting
though
she
did
not
know
which
one
day
while
she
was
looking
at
the
hat
of
the
old
woman
painted
with
flowers
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
rose
the
old
woman
had
forgotten
to
take
it
from
her
hat
when
she
made
the
others
vanish
in
the
earth
but
so
it
is
when
one’s
thoughts
are
not
collected
what
said
gerda
are
there
no
roses
here
and
she
ran
about
amongst
the
flowerbeds
and
looked
and
looked
but
there
was
not
one
to
be
found
she
then
sat
down
and
wept
but
her
hot
tears
fell
just
where
a
rose-bush
had
sunk
and
when
her
warm
tears
watered
the
ground
the
tree
shot
up
suddenly
as
fresh
and
blooming
as
when
it
had
been
swallowed
up
gerda
kissed
the
roses
thought
of
her
own
dear
roses
at
home
and
with
them
of
little
kay
oh
how
long
i
have
stayed
said
the
little
girl
i
intended
to
look
for
kay
don’t
you
know
where
he
is
she
asked
of
the
roses
do
you
think
he
is
dead
and
gone
dead
he
certainly
is
not
said
the
roses
we
have
been
in
the
earth
where
all
the
dead
are
but
kay
was
not
there
many
thanks
said
little
gerda
and
she
went
to
the
other
flowers
looked
into
their
cups
and
asked
don’t
you
know
where
little
kay
is
but
every
flower
stood
in
the
sunshine
and
dreamed
its
own
fairy
tale
or
its
own
story
and
they
all
told
her
very
many
things
but
not
one
knew
anything
of
kay
well
what
did
the
tiger-lily
say
hearest
thou
not

bum
those
are
the
only

the
plaintive

the

don’t

that
at

that

what
did
the
convolvulus
say
projecting
over
a
narrow
mountain-path
there
hangs
an
old
feudal
castle
thick
evergreens
grow
on
the
dilapidated
walls
and
around
the
altar
where
a
lovely
maiden
is
standing
she
bends
over
the
railing
and
looks
out
upon
the
rose

on

branches
than
she

rustling
‘is
he
not
yet
come?’
is
it
kay
that
you
mean
asked
little
gerda
i
am
speaking
about
my
story—about
my
dream
answered
the
convolvulus
what
did
the
snowdrops
say
between
the
trees
a
long
board
is
hanging—it
is
a
swing
two
little
girls
are
sitting
in
it
and
swing
themselves
backwards
and
forwards
their
frocks
are
as
white
as
snow
and
long
green
silk
ribands
flutter
from
their
bonnets
their
brother
who
is
older
than
they
are
stands
up
in
the
swing
he
twines
his
arms
round
the
cords
to
hold
himself
fast
for
in
one
hand
he
has
a
little
cup
and
in
the
other
a
clay-pipe
he
is
blowing
soap-bubbles
the
swing
moves
and
the
bubbles
float
in
charming
changing
colors
the
last
is
still
hanging
to
the
end
of
the
pipe
and
rocks
in
the
breeze
the
swing
moves
the
little
black
dog
as
light
as
a
soap-bubble
jumps
up
on
his
hind
legs
to
try
to
get
into
the
swing
it
moves
the
dog
falls
down
barks
and
is
angry
they
tease
him
the
bubble
bursts
a
swing
a
bursting
bubble—such
is
my
song
what
you
relate
may
be
very
pretty
but
you
tell
it
in
so
melancholy
a
manner
and
do
not
mention
kay
what
do
the
hyacinths
say
there
were
once
upon
a
time
three
sisters
quite
transparent
and
very
beautiful
the
robe
of
the
one
was
red
that
of
the
second
blue
and
that
of
the
third
white
they
danced
hand
in
hand
beside
the
calm
lake
in
the
clear
moonshine
they
were
not
elfin
maidens
but
mortal
children
a
sweet
fragrance
was
smelt
and
the
maidens
vanished
in
the
wood
the
fragrance
grew
stronger—three
coffins
and
in
them
three
lovely
maidens
glided
out
of
the
forest
and
across
the
lake
the
shining
glow-worms
flew
around
like
little
floating
lights
do
the
dancing
maidens
sleep
or
are
they
dead
the
odour
of
the
flowers
says
they
are
corpses
the
evening
bell
tolls
for
the
dead
you
make
me
quite
sad
said
little
gerda
i
cannot
help
thinking
of
the
dead
maidens
oh
is
little
kay
really
dead
the
roses
have
been
in
the
earth
and
they
say
no
ding
dong
sounded
the
hyacinth
bells
we
do
not
toll
for
little
kay
we
do
not
know
him
that
is
our
way
of
singing
the
only
one
we
have
and
gerda
went
to
the
ranunculuses
that
looked
forth
from
among
the
shining
green
leaves
you
are
a
little
bright
sun
said
gerda
tell
me
if
you
know
where
i
can
find
my
playfellow
and
the
ranunculus
shone
brightly
and
looked
again
at
gerda
what
song
could
the
ranunculus
sing
it
was
one
that
said
nothing

in
a
small
court
the
bright
sun
was
shining
in
the
first
days
of
spring
the
beams
glided
down
the
white
walls
of
a
neighbor’s
house
and
close
by
the
fresh
yellow
flowers
were
growing
shining
like
gold
in
the
warm
sun-rays
an
old
grandmother
was
sitting
in
the
air
her
grand-daughter
the
poor
and
lovely
servant
just
come
for
a
short
visit
she
knows
her
grandmother
there
was
gold
pure
virgin
gold
in
that
blessed
kiss
there
that
is
my
little
story
said
the
ranunculus
my
poor
old
grandmother
sighed
gerda
yes
she
is
longing
for
me
no
doubt
she
is
sorrowing
for
me
as
she
did
for
little
kay
but
i
will
soon
come
home
and
then
i
will
bring
kay
with
me
it
is
of
no
use
asking
the
flowers
they
only
know
their
own
old
rhymes
and
can
tell
me
nothing
and
she
tucked
up
her
frock
to
enable
her
to
run
quicker
but
the
narcissus
gave
her
a
knock
on
the
leg
just
as
she
was
going
to
jump
over
it
so
she
stood
still
looked
at
the
long
yellow
flower
and
asked
you
perhaps
know
something
and
she
bent
down
to
the
narcissus
and
what
did
it
say
i
can
see
myself—i
can
see
myself
oh
how
odorous
i
am
up
in
the
little
garret
there
stands
half-dressed
a
little
dancer
she
stands
now
on
one
leg
now
on
both
she
despises
the
whole
world
yet
she
lives
only
in
imagination
she
pours
water
out
of
the
teapot
over
a
piece
of
stuff
which
she
holds
in
her
hand
it
is
the
bodice
cleanliness
is
a
fine
thing
the
white
dress
is
hanging
on
the
hook
it
was
washed
in
the
teapot
and
dried
on
the
roof
she
puts
it
on
ties
a
saffron-colored
kerchief
round
her
neck
and
then
the
gown
looks
whiter
i
can
see
myself—i
can
see
myself
that’s
nothing
to
me
said
little
gerda
that
does
not
concern
me
and
then
off
she
ran
to
the
further
end
of
the
garden
the
gate
was
locked
but
she
shook
the
rusted
bolt
till
it
was
loosened
and
the
gate
opened
and
little
gerda
ran
off
barefooted
into
the
wide
world
she
looked
round
her
thrice
but
no
one
followed
her
at
last
she
could
run
no
longer
she
sat
down
on
a
large
stone
and
when
she
looked
about
her
she
saw
that
the
summer
had
passed
it
was
late
in
the
autumn
but
that
one
could
not
remark
in
the
beautiful
garden
where
there
was
always
sunshine
and
where
there
were
flowers
the
whole
year
round
dear
me
how
long
i
have
staid
said
gerda
autumn
is
come
i
must
not
rest
any
longer
and
she
got
up
to
go
further
oh
how
tender
and
wearied
her
little
feet
were
all
around
it
looked
so
cold
and
raw
the
long
willow-leaves
were
quite
yellow
and
the
fog
dripped
from
them
like
water
one
leaf
fell
after
the
other
the
sloes
only
stood
full
of
fruit
which
set
one’s
teeth
on
edge
oh
how
dark
and
comfortless
it
was
in
the
dreary
world
fourth
story
the
prince
and
princess
gerda
was
obliged
to
rest
herself
again
when
exactly
opposite
to
her
a
large
raven
came
hopping
over
the
white
snow
he
had
long
been
looking
at
gerda
and
shaking
his
head
and
now
he
said
caw
caw
good
day
good
day
he
could
not
say
it
better
but
he
felt
a
sympathy
for
the
little
girl
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
all
alone
the
word
alone
gerda
understood
quite
well
and
felt
how
much
was
expressed
by
it
so
she
told
the
raven
her
whole
history
and
asked
if
he
had
not
seen
kay
the
raven
nodded
very
gravely
and
said
it
may
be—it
may
be
what
do
you
really
think
so
cried
the
little
girl
and
she
nearly
squeezed
the
raven
to
death
so
much
did
she
kiss
him
gently
gently
said
the
raven
i
think
i
know
i

may

forgotten
you
for
the
princess
does
he
live
with
a
princess
asked
gerda
yes—listen
said
the
raven
but
it
will
be
difficult
for
me
to
speak
your
language
if
you
understand
the
raven
language
i
can
tell
you
better
no
i
have
not
learnt
it
said
gerda
but
my
grandmother
understands
it
and
she
can
speak
gibberish
too
i
wish
i
had
learnt
it
no
matter
said
the
raven
i
will
tell
you
as
well
as
i
can
however
it
will
be
bad
enough
and
then
he
told
all
he
knew
in
the
kingdom
where
we
now
are
there
lives
a
princess
who
is
extraordinarily
clever
for
she
has
read
all
the
newspapers
in
the
whole
world
and
has
forgotten
them
again—so
clever
is
she
she
was
lately
it
is
said
sitting
on
her
throne—which
is
not
very
amusing
after
all—when
she
began
humming
an
old
tune
and
it
was
just
‘oh
why
should
i
not
be
married?’
‘that
song
is
not
without
its
meaning,’
said
she
and
so
then
she
was
determined
to
marry
but
she
would
have
a
husband
who
knew
how
to
give
an
answer
when
he
was
spoken
to—not
one
who
looked
only
as
if
he
were
a
great
personage
for
that
is
so
tiresome
she
then
had
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
drummed
together
and
when
they
heard
her
intention
all
were
very
pleased
and
said
‘we
are
very
glad
to
hear
it
it
is
the
very
thing
we
were
thinking
of.’
you
may
believe
every
word
i
say
said
the
raven
for
i
have
a
tame
sweetheart
that
hops
about
in
the
palace
quite
free
and
it
was
she
who
told
me
all
this
the
newspapers
appeared
forthwith
with
a
border
of
hearts
and
the
initials
of
the
princess
and
therein
you
might
read
that
every
good-looking
young
man
was
at
liberty
to
come
to
the
palace
and
speak
to
the
princess
and
he
who
spoke
in
such
wise
as
showed
he
felt
himself
at
home
there
that
one
the
princess
would
choose
for
her
husband
yes
yes
said
the
raven
you
may
believe
it
it
is
as
true
as
i
am
sitting
here
people
came
in
crowds
there
was
a
crush
and
a
hurry
but
no
one
was
successful
either
on
the
first
or
second
day
they
could
all
talk
well
enough
when
they
were
out
in
the
street
but
as
soon
as
they
came
inside
the
palace
gates
and
saw
the
guard
richly
dressed
in
silver
and
the
lackeys
in
gold
on
the
staircase
and
the
large
illuminated
saloons
then
they
were
abashed
and
when
they
stood
before
the
throne
on
which
the
princess
was
sitting
all
they
could
do
was
to
repeat
the
last
word
they
had
uttered
and
to
hear
it
again
did
not
interest
her
very
much
it
was
just
as
if
the
people
within
were
under
a
charm
and
had
fallen
into
a
trance
till
they
came
out
again
into
the
street
for
then—oh
then—they
could
chatter
enough
there
was
a
whole
row
of
them
standing
from
the
town-gates
to
the
palace
i
was
there
myself
to
look
said
the
raven
they
grew
hungry
and
thirsty
but
from
the
palace
they
got
nothing
whatever
not
even
a
glass
of
water
some
of
the
cleverest
it
is
true
had
taken
bread
and
butter
with
them
but
none
shared
it
with
his
neighbor
for
each
thought
‘let
him
look
hungry
and
then
the
princess
won’t
have
him.’
but
kay—little
kay
said
gerda
when
did
he
come
was
he
among
the
number

patience
we
are
just
come
to
him
it
was
on
the
third
day
when
a
little
personage
without
horse
or
equipage
came
marching
right
boldly
up
to
the
palace
his
eyes
shone
like
yours
he
had
beautiful
long
hair
but
his
clothes
were
very
shabby
that
was
kay
cried
gerda
with
a
voice
of
delight
oh
now
i’ve
found
him
and
she
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
he
had
a
little
knapsack
at
his
back
said
the
raven
no
that
was
certainly
his
sledge

minutely
but
i
know
from
my
tame
sweetheart
that
when
he
came
into
the
court-yard
of
the
palace
and
saw
the
body-guard
in
silver
the
lackeys
on
the
staircase
he
was
not
the
least
abashed
he
nodded
and
said
to
them
‘it
must
be
very
tiresome
to
stand
on
the
stairs
for
my
part
i
shall
go
in.’
the
saloons
were
gleaming
with
lustres—privy
councillors
and
excellencies
were
walking
about
barefooted
and
wore
gold
keys
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
feel
uncomfortable
his
boots
creaked
too
so
loudly
but
still
he
was
not
at
all
afraid
that’s
kay
for
certain
said
gerda
i
know
he
had
on
new
boots
i
have
heard
them
creaking
in
grandmama’s
room
yes
they
creaked
said
the
raven
and
on
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
princess
who
was
sitting
on
a
pearl
as
large
as
a
spinning-wheel
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
with
their
attendants
and
attendants’
attendants
and
all
the
cavaliers
with
their
gentlemen
and
gentlemen’s
gentlemen
stood
round
and
the
nearer
they
stood
to
the
door
the
prouder
they
looked
it
was
hardly
possible
to
look
at
the
gentleman’s
gentleman
so
very
haughtily
did
he
stand
in
the
doorway
it
must
have
been
terrible
said
little
gerda
and
did
kay
get
the
princess
were
i
not
a
raven
i
should
have
taken
the
princess
myself
although
i
am
promised
it
is
said
he
spoke
as
well
as
i
speak
when
i
talk
raven
language
this
i
learned
from
my
tame
sweetheart
he
was
bold
and
nicely
behaved
he
had
not
come
to
woo
the
princess
but
only
to
hear
her
wisdom
she
pleased
him
and
he
pleased
her
yes
yes
for
certain
that
was
kay
said
gerda
he
was
so
clever
he
could
reckon
fractions
in
his
head
oh
won’t
you
take
me
to
the
palace
that
is
very
easily
said
answered
the
raven
but
how
are
we
to
manage
it
i’ll
speak
to
my
tame
sweetheart
about
it
she
must
advise
us
for
so
much
i
must
tell
you
such
a
little
girl
as
you
are
will
never
get
permission
to
enter
oh
yes
i
shall
said
gerda
when
kay
hears
that
i
am
here
he
will
come
out
directly
to
fetch
me
wait
for
me
here
on
these
steps
said
the
raven
he
moved
his
head
backwards
and
forwards
and
flew
away
the
evening
was
closing
in
when
the
raven
returned
caw—caw
said
he
she
sends
you
her
compliments
and
here
is
a
roll
for
you
she
took
it
out
of
the
kitchen
where
there
is
bread
enough
you
are
hungry
no
doubt
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
enter
the
palace
for
you
are
barefooted
the
guards
in
silver
and
the
lackeys
in
gold
would
not
allow
it
but
do
not
cry
you
shall
come
in
still
my
sweetheart
knows
a
little
back
stair
that
leads
to
the
bedchamber
and
she
knows
where
she
can
get
the
key
of
it
and
they
went
into
the
garden
in
the
large
avenue
where
one
leaf
was
falling
after
the
other
and
when
the
lights
in
the
palace
had
all
gradually
disappeared
the
raven
led
little
gerda
to
the
back
door
which
stood
half
open
oh
how
gerda’s
heart
beat
with
anxiety
and
longing
it
was
just
as
if
she
had
been
about
to
do
something
wrong
and
yet
she
only
wanted
to
know
if
little
kay
was
there
yes
he
must
be
there
she
called
to
mind
his
intelligent
eyes
and
his
long
hair
so
vividly
she
could
quite
see
him
as
he
used
to
laugh
when
they
were
sitting
under
the
roses
at
home
he
will
no
doubt
be
glad
to
see
you
to
hear
what
a
long
way
you
have
come
for
his
sake
to
know
how
unhappy
all
at
home

when
he
did
not
come
back
oh
what
a
fright
and
a
joy
it
was
they
were
now
on
the
stairs
a
single
lamp
was
burning
there
and
on
the
floor
stood
the
tame
raven
turning
her
head
on
every
side
and
looking
at
gerda
who
bowed
as
her
grandmother
had
taught
her
to
do
my
intended
has
told
me
so
much
good
of
you
my
dear
young
lady
said
the
tame
raven
your
tale
is
very
affecting
if
you
will
take
the
lamp
i
will
go
before
we
will
go
straight
on
for
we
shall
meet
no
one
i
think
there
is
somebody
just
behind
us
said
gerda
and
something
rushed
past
it
was
like
shadowy
figures
on
the
wall
horses
with
flowing
manes
and
thin
legs
huntsmen
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
horseback
they
are
only
dreams
said
the
raven
they
come
to
fetch
the
thoughts
of
the
high
personages
to
the
chase
‘tis
well
for
now
you
can
observe
them
in
bed
all
the
better
but
let
me
find
when
you
enjoy
honor
and
distinction
that
you
possess
a
grateful
heart
tut
that’s
not
worth
talking
about
said
the
raven
of
the
woods
they
now
entered
the
first
saloon
which
was
of
rose-colored
satin
with
artificial
flowers
on
the
wall
here
the
dreams
were
rushing
past
but
they
hastened
by
so
quickly
that
gerda
could
not
see
the
high
personages
one
hall
was
more
magnificent
than
the
other
one
might
indeed
well
be
abashed
and
at
last
they
came
into
the
bedchamber
the
ceiling
of
the
room
resembled
a
large
palm-tree
with
leaves
of
glass
of
costly
glass
and
in
the
middle
from
a
thick
golden
stem
hung
two
beds
each
of
which
resembled
a
lily
one
was
white
and
in
this
lay
the
princess
the
other
was
red
and
it
was
here
that
gerda
was
to
look
for
little
kay
she
bent
back
one
of
the
red
leaves
and
saw
a
brown
neck
oh
that
was
kay
she
called
him
quite
loud
by
name
held
the
lamp
towards
him—the
dreams
rushed
back
again
into
the
chamber—he
awoke
turned
his
head
and—it
was
not
little
kay
the
prince
was
only
like
him
about
the
neck
but
he
was
young
and
handsome
and
out
of
the
white
lily
leaves
the
princess
peeped
too
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
then
little
gerda
cried
and
told
her
her
whole
history
and
all
that
the
ravens
had
done
for
her
poor
little
thing
said
the
prince
and
the
princess
they
praised
the
ravens
very
much
and
told
them
they
were
not
at
all
angry
with
them
but
they
were
not
to
do
so
again
however
they
should
have
a
reward
will
you
fly
about
here
at
liberty
asked
the
princess
or
would
you
like
to
have
a
fixed
appointment
as
court
ravens
with
all
the
broken
bits
from
the
kitchen
and
both
the
ravens
nodded
and
begged
for
a
fixed
appointment
for
they
thought
of
their
old
age
and
said
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
provision
for
our
old
days
and
the
prince
got
up
and
let
gerda
sleep
in
his
bed
and
more
than
this
he
could
not
do
she
folded
her
little
hands
and
thought
how
good
men
and
animals
are
and
she
then
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
all
the
dreams
flew
in
again
and
they
now
looked
like
the
angels
they
drew
a
little
sledge
in
which
little
kay
sat
and
nodded
his
head
but
the
whole
was
only
a
dream
and
therefore
it
all
vanished
as
soon
as
she
awoke
the
next
day
she
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
silk
and
velvet
they
offered
to
let
her
stay
at
the
palace
and
lead
a
happy
life
but
she
begged
to
have
a
little
carriage
with
a
horse
in
front
and
for
a
small
pair
of
shoes
then
she
said
she
would
again
go
forth
in

and
look
for
kay
shoes
and

muff
were
given
her

off
a
new
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
it
was
of
pure
gold
and
the
arms
of
the
prince
and
princess
shone
like
a
star
upon
it
the
coachman
the

too

the

assisted
her
into
the
carriage
themselves
and
wished
her
all
success
the
raven
of
the
woods
who
was
now
married
accompanied
her
for
the
first
three
miles
he
sat
beside
gerda
for
he
could
not
bear
riding
backwards
the
other
raven
stood
in
the
doorway
and
flapped
her
wings
she
could
not
accompany
gerda
because
she
suffered
from
headache
since
she
had
had
a
fixed
appointment
and
ate
so
much
the
carriage
was
lined
inside
with
sugar-plums
and
in
the
seats
were
fruits
and
gingerbread
farewell
farewell
cried
prince
and
princess
and
gerda
wept
and
the
raven
wept
thus
passed
the
first
miles
and
then
the
raven
bade
her
farewell
and
this
was
the
most
painful
separation
of
all
he
flew
into
a
tree
and
beat
his
black
wings
as
long
as
he
could
see
the
carriage
that
shone
from
afar
like

sunbeam

the

they
drove
through
the
dark
wood
but
the
carriage
shone
like
a
torch
and
it
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
robbers
so
that
they
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
‘tis
gold
‘tis
gold
they
cried
and
they
rushed
forward
seized
the
horses
knocked
down
the
little
postilion
the
coachman
and
the
servants
and
pulled
little
gerda
out
of
the
carriage
how
plump
how
beautiful
she
is
she
must
have
been
fed
on
nut-kernels
said
the
old
female
robber
who
had
a
long
scrubby
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
hung
down
over
her
eyes
she
is
as
good
as
a
fatted
lamb
how
nice
she
will
be
and
then
she
drew
out
a
knife
the
blade
of
which
shone
so
that
it
was
quite
dreadful
to
behold
oh
cried
the
woman
at
the
same
moment
she
had
been
bitten
in
the
ear
by
her
own
little
daughter
who
hung
at
her
back
and
who
was
so
wild
and
unmanageable
that
it
was
quite
amusing
to
see
her
you
naughty
child
said
the
mother
and
now
she
had
not
time
to
kill
gerda
she
shall
play
with
me
said
the
little
robber
child
she
shall
give
me
her
muff
and
her
pretty
frock
she
shall
sleep
in
my
bed
and
then
she
gave
her
mother
another
bite
so
that
she
jumped
and
ran
round
with
the
pain
and
the
robbers
laughed
and
said
look
how
she
is
dancing
with
the
little
one
i
will
go
into
the
carriage
said
the
little
robber
maiden
and
she
would
have
her
will
for
she
was
very
spoiled
and
very
headstrong
she
and
gerda
got
in
and
then
away
they
drove
over
the
stumps
of
felled
trees
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods
the
little
robber
maiden
was
as
tall
as
gerda
but
stronger
broader-shouldered
and
of
dark
complexion
her
eyes
were
quite
black
they
looked
almost
melancholy
she
embraced
little
gerda
and
said
they
shall
not
kill
you
as
long
as
i
am
not
displeased
with
you
you
are
doubtless
a
princess
no
said
little
gerda
who
then
related
all
that
had
happened
to
her
and
how
much
she
cared
about
little
kay
the
little
robber
maiden
looked
at
her
with
a
serious
air
nodded
her
head
slightly
and
said
they
shall
not
kill
you
even
if
i
am
angry
with
you
then
i
will
do
it
myself
and
she
dried

bark
for
that
was
forbidden
in
the
midst
of
the
large
old
smoking
hall
burnt
a
great
fire
on
the
stone
floor
the
smoke
disappeared
under
the
stones
and
had
to
seek
its
own
egress
in
an
immense
caldron
soup
was
boiling
and
rabbits
and
hares
were
being
roasted
on
a
spit
you
shall
sleep
with
me
to-night
with
all
my
animals
said
the
little
robber
maiden
they
had
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
then
went
into
a
corner
where
straw
and
carpets
were
lying
beside
them
on
laths
and
perches
sat
nearly
a
hundred
pigeons
all
asleep
seemingly
but
yet
they
moved
a
little
when
the
robber
maiden
came
they
are
all
mine
said
she
at
the
same
time
seizing
one
that
was
next
to
her
by
the
legs
and
shaking
it
so
that
its
wings
fluttered
kiss
it
cried
the
little
girl
and
flung
the
pigeon
in
gerda’s
face
up
there
is
the
rabble
of
the
wood
continued
she
pointing
to
several
laths
which
were
fastened
before
a
hole
high
up
in
the
wall
that’s
the
rabble
they
would
all
fly
away
immediately
if
they
were
not
well
fastened
in
and
here
is
my
dear
old
bac
and
she
laid
hold
of
the
horns
of
a
reindeer
that
had
a
bright
copper
ring
round
its
neck
and
was
tethered
to
the
spot
we
are
obliged
to
lock
this
fellow
in
too
or
he
would
make
his
escape
every
evening
i
tickle
his
neck
with
my
sharp
knife
he
is
so
frightened
at
it
and
the
little
girl
drew
forth
a
long
knife
from
a
crack
in
the
wall
and
let
it
glide
over
the
reindeer’s
neck
the
poor
animal
kicked
the
girl
laughed
and
pulled
gerda
into
bed
with
her
do
you
intend
to
keep
your
knife
while
you
sleep
asked
gerda
looking
at
it
rather
fearfully
i
always
sleep
with
the
knife
said
the
little
robber
maiden
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
happen
but
tell
me
now
once
more
all
about
little
kay
and
why
you
have
started
off
in
the
wide
world
alone
and
gerda
related
all
from
the
very
beginning
the
wood-pigeons
cooed
above
in
their
cage
and
the
others
slept
the
little
robber
maiden
wound
her
arm
round
gerda’s
neck
held
the
knife
in
the
other
hand
and
snored
so
loud
that
everybody
could
hear
her
but
gerda
could
not
close
her
eyes
for
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
to
live
or
die
the
robbers
sat
round
the
fire
sang
and
drank
and
the
old
female
robber
jumped
about
so
that
it
was
quite
dreadful
for
gerda
to
see
her
then
the
wood-pigeons
said
coo
coo
we
have
seen
little
kay
a
white
hen
carries
his
sledge
he
himself
sat
in
the
carriage
of
the
snow
queen
who
passed
here
down
just
over
the
wood
as
we
lay
in
our
nest
she
blew
upon
us
young
ones
and
all
died
except
we
two
coo
coo
what
is
that
you
say
up
there
cried
little
gerda
where
did
the
snow
queen
go
to
do
you
know
anything
about
it
she
is
no
doubt
gone
to
lapland
for
there
is
always
snow
and
ice
there
only
ask
the
reindeer
who
is
tethered
there
ice
and
snow
is
there
there
it
is
glorious
and
beautiful
said
the
reindeer
one
can
spring
about
in
the
large
shining
valleys
the
snow
queen
has
her
summer-tent
there
but
her
fixed
abode
is
high
up
towards
the
north
pole
on
the
island
called
spitzbergen
oh
kay
poor
little
kay
sighed
gerda
do
you
choose
to
be
quiet
said
the
robber
maiden
if
you
don’t
i
shall
make
you
in
the
morning
gerda
told
her
all
that
the
wood-pigeons
had
said
and
the
little
maiden

flew
to
her
mother
with
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
pulling
her
by
the
beard
said
good
morrow
my
own
sweet
nanny-goat
of
a
mother
and
her
mother
took
hold
of
her
nose
and
pinched
it
till
it
was
red
and
blue
but
this
was
all
done
out
of
pure
love
when
the
mother
had
taken
a
sup
at
her
flask
and
was
having
a
nap
the
little
robber
maiden
went
to
the
reindeer
and
said
i
should
very
much
like
to
give
you
still
many
a
tickling
with
the
sharp
knife
for
then
you
are
so
amusing
however
i
will
untether
you
and
help
you
out
so
that
you
may
go
back
to
lapland
but
you
must
make
good
use
of
your
legs
and
take
this
little
girl
for
me
to
the
palace
of
the
snow
queen
where
her
playfellow
is
you
have
heard
i
suppose
all
she
said
for
she
spoke
loud
enough
and
you
were
listening
the
reindeer
gave
a
bound
for
joy
the
robber
maiden
lifted
up
little
gerda
and
took
the
precaution
to
bind
her
fast
on
the
reindeer’s
back
she
even
gave
her
a
small
cushion
to
sit
on
here
are
your
worsted
leggins
for
it
will
be
cold
but
the
muff
i
shall
keep
for
myself
for
it
is
so

pretty
but
i
do
not

look
about
the
hands
just
like
my
ugly
old
mother
and
gerda
wept
for
joy
i
can’t
bear
to
see
you
fretting
said
the
little
robber
maiden
this
is
just
the
time
when
you
ought
to
look
pleased
here

two
loaves
and
a

for
you
so
that
you
won’t

the
bread
and
the
meat
were
fastened
to
the
reindeer’s

the
little
maiden
opened
the
door
called
in
all
the
dogs
and
then
with
her
knife
cut
the
rope
that
fastened
the
animal
and
said
to
him
now
off
with
you
but
take
good
care

gerda
stretched
out
her
hands
with
the
large
wadded
gloves
towards
the
robber
maiden

said
farewell

the
reindeer
flew
on

her

had
warmed
herself
and
had
eaten

a

words
on

to
take

her
on

was
again

in

the
most
charming
blue
lights
burned
the
whole
night
in

and
at
last
they
came
to
finland
they
knocked
at
the
chimney
of
the
finland
woman
for
as
to
a
door
she
had
none
there
was
such
a
heat
inside
that
the
finland
woman
herself
went
about
almost
naked
she
was
diminutive
and
dirty
she
immediately
loosened
little
gerda’s
clothes
pulled
off
her
thick
gloves
and
boots
for
otherwise
the
heat
would
have
been
too
great—and
after
laying
a
piece
of
ice
on
the
reindeer’s
head
read
what
was
written
on
the
fish-skin
she
read
it
three
times
she
then
knew
it
by
heart
so
she
put
the
fish
into
the
cupboard—for
it
might
very
well
be
eaten
and
she
never
threw
anything
away
then
the
reindeer
related
his
own
story
first
and
afterwards
that
of
little
gerda
and
the
finland
woman
winked
her
eyes
but
said
nothing

are

clever

loosens

the
strength
of

men
said
the
finland
woman
much
good
that
would
be
then
she
went
to
a
cupboard
and
drew
out
a
large
skin
rolled
up
when
she
had
unrolled
it
strange
characters
were
to
be
seen
written
thereon
and
the
finland
woman
read
at
such
a
rate
that
the
perspiration
trickled
down
her
forehead
but
the
reindeer
begged
so
hard
for
little
gerda
and
gerda
looked
so
imploringly
with
tearful
eyes
at
the
finland
woman
that
she
winked
and
drew
the
reindeer
aside
into
a
corner
where
they
whispered
together
while
the
animal
got
some
fresh
ice
put
on
his
head
‘tis
true
little
kay
is
at
the

queen’s
and
finds
everything
there
quite
to
his
taste
and
he
thinks
it
the
very
best
place
in
the
world
but
the
reason
of
that
is
he
has
a
splinter
of
glass
in
his
eye
and
in
his
heart
these
must
be
got
out
first
otherwise
he
will
never
go
back
to
mankind

the

will
retain

power

him

can

to

which
will
endue
her
with

her
no

what
she

already

it
is
don’t
you
see

she
must
not

they
were

bright

shining

borealis
the
flakes
ran
along
the
ground
and
the
nearer
they
came
the
larger
they
grew
gerda
well
remembered
how
large
and
strange
the
snow-flakes
appeared
when
she
once
saw
them
through
a
magnifying-glass
but
now
they
were
large
and
terrific
in
another
manner—they
were
all
alive
they
were
the
outposts
of
the
snow
queen
they
had
the
most
wondrous
shapes
some
looked
like
large
ugly
porcupines
others
like
snakes
knotted
together
with
their
heads
sticking
out
and
others
again
like
small
fat
bears
with
the
hair
standing
on
end
all
were
of
dazzling
whiteness—all
were
living
snow-flakes
little
gerda
repeated
the
lord’s
prayer
the
cold
was
so
intense
that
she
could
see
her
own
breath
which
came
like
smoke
out
of
her
mouth
it
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
took
the
form
of
little
angels
that
grew
more
and
more
when
they
touched
the
earth
all
had
helms
on
their
heads
and
lances
and
shields
in
their
hands
they
increased
in
numbers
and
when
gerda
had
finished
the
lord’s
prayer
she
was
surrounded
by
a
whole
legion
they
thrust
at
the
horrid
snow-flakes
with
their
spears
so
that
they
flew
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
little
gerda
walked
on
bravely
and
in
security
the
angels
patted
her
hands
and
feet
and
then
she
felt
the
cold
less
and
went
on

was
dragging
along

laid

then
away
she
flew
and
kay
sat
quite
alone
in
the
empty
halls
of
ice
that
were
miles
long
and
looked
at
the
blocks
of

and
thought
and
thought
till
his
skull
was
almost
cracked
there
he
sat
quite
benumbed
and
motionless
one
would
have
imagined
he
was
frozen
to
death
suddenly
little
gerda
stepped
through
the
great
portal
into
the
palace
the
gate
was
formed
of
cutting
winds
but
gerda
repeated
her
evening
prayer
and
the
winds
were
laid
as
though
they
slept
and
the
little
maiden
entered
the
vast
empty
cold
halls
there
she
beheld
kay
she
recognised
him
flew
to
embrace
him
and
cried
out
her
arms
firmly
holding
him
the
while
kay
sweet
little
kay
have
i
then
found
you
at
last
but
he
sat
quite
still
benumbed
and
cold
then
little
gerda
shed
burning
tears
and
they
fell
on
his
bosom
they
penetrated
to
his
heart
they
thawed
the
lumps
of
ice
and
consumed
the
splinters
of
the
looking-glass
he
looked
at
her
and
she
sang
the
hymn
the
rose
in
the
valley
is
blooming
so
sweet
and
angels
descend
there
the
children
to
greet
hereupon
kay
burst
into
tears
he
wept
so
much
that
the
splinter
rolled
out
of
his
eye
and
he
recognised
her
and
shouted
gerda
sweet
little
gerda
where
have
you
been
so
long
and
where
have
i
been
he
looked
round
him
how
cold
it
is
here
said
he
how
empty
and
cold
and
he
held
fast
by
gerda
who
laughed
and
wept
for
joy
it
was
so
beautiful
that
even
the
blocks
of
ice
danced
about
for
joy
and
when
they
were
tired
and
laid
themselves
down
they
formed
exactly
the
letters
which
the
snow
queen
had
told
him
to
find
out
so
now
he
was
his
own
master
and
he
would
have
the
whole
world
and
a
pair
of
new
skates
into
the
bargain
gerda
kissed
his
cheeks
and
they
grew
quite
blooming
she
kissed
his
eyes
and
they
shone
like
her
own
she
kissed
his
hands
and
feet
and
he
was
again
well
and
merry

queen
might
come
back

liked

when
they
reached

with

they

waiting
for

he
had
brought
another
a
young
one
with
him
whose

was
filled
with
milk

he
gave
to

ones

kissed

then
carried

gerda—first
to
the
finland
woman
where
they
warmed
themselves
in
the
warm
room
and
learned
what
they
were
to
do
on

and
they
went
to
the

woman
who
made
some
new

for

repaired

the

and
the

leaped
along
beside
them
and
accompanied
them
to

here
the

peeped
forth
here

and
gerda
took
leave
of
the
lapland
woman
farewell
farewell
they
all
said
and
the
first
green
buds
appeared
the
first
little
birds
began
to
chirrup
and
out
of
the
wood
came
riding
on
a
magnificent
horse
which
gerda
knew
it
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
golden
carriage
a
young
damsel
with
a
bright-red
cap
on

it

in

if
that
did
not
please
her
she
recognised
gerda
immediately
and
gerda
knew
her
too
it
was
a
joyful
meeting
you
are
a
fine
fellow
for
tramping
about
said
she
to

kay

if
you
deserve

one
should
run
from

end
of

but
the
raven
asked
little
gerda
oh
the
raven
is
dead
she
answered
his
tame
sweetheart
is
a
widow
and
wears
a
bit
of
black
worsted
round
her
leg
she
laments
most
piteously
but
it’s
all
mere
talk
and
stuff
now
tell
me
what
you’ve
been
doing
and
how
you
managed
to
catch
him
and
gerda
and
kay
both
told
their
story
and
schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre
said
the
robber
maiden
and
she
took
the
hands
of
each
and
promised
that
if
she
should
some
day
pass
through
the
town
where
they
lived
she
would
come
and
visit
them
and
then
away
she
rode
kay
and
gerda
took
each
other’s
hand
it
was
lovely
spring
weather
with
abundance
of
flowers
and
of
verdure
the
church-bells
rang
and
the
children
recognised
the
high
towers
and
the
large
town
it
was
that
in
which
they
dwelt
they
entered
and
hastened
up
to
their
grandmother’s
room
where
everything
was
standing
as
formerly
the
clock
said
tick
tack
and
the
finger
moved
round
but
as
they
entered
they
remarked
that
they
were
now
grown
up
the
roses
on
the
leads
hung
blooming
in
at
the
open
window
there
stood
the
little
children’s
chairs
and
kay
and
gerda
sat
down
on
them
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
they
both
had
forgotten
the
cold
empty
splendor
of
the
snow
queen
as
though
it
had
been
a
dream
the
grandmother
sat
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
read
aloud
from
the
bible
unless
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
cannot
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
kay
and
gerda
looked
in
each
other’s
eyes
and
all
at
once
they
understood
the
old
hymn
the
rose
in
the
valley
is
blooming
so
sweet
and
angels
descend
there
the
children
to
greet
there
sat
the
two
grown-up
persons
grown-up
and
yet
children
children
at
least
in
heart
and
it
was
summer-time
summer
glorious
summer
the
leap-frog
a
flea
a
grasshopper
and
a
leap-frog
once
wanted
to
see
which
could
jump
highest
and
they
invited
the
whole
world
and
everybody
else
besides
who
chose
to
come
to
see
the
festival
three
famous
jumpers
were
they
as
everyone
would
say
when
they
all
met
together
in
the
room
i
will
give
my
daughter
to
him
who
jumps
highest
exclaimed
the
king
for
it
is
not
so
amusing
where
there
is
no
prize
to
jump
for
the
flea
was
the
first
to
step
forward
he
had
exquisite
manners
and
bowed
to
the
company
on
all
sides
for
he
had
noble
blood
and
was
moreover
accustomed
to
the
society
of
man
alone
and
that
makes
a
great
difference
then
came
the
grasshopper
he
was
considerably
heavier
but
he
was
well-mannered
and
wore
a
green
uniform
which
he
had
by
right
of
birth
he
said
moreover
that
he
belonged
to
a
very
ancient
egyptian
family
and
that
in
the
house
where
he
then
was
he
was
thought
much
of
the
fact
was
he
had
been
just
brought
out
of
the
fields
and
put
in
a
pasteboard
house
three
stories
high
all
made
of
court-cards
with
the
colored
side
inwards
and
doors
and
windows
cut
out
of
the
body
of
the
queen
of
hearts
i
sing
so
well
said
he
that
sixteen
native
grasshoppers
who
have
chirped
from
infancy
and
yet
got
no
house
built
of
cards
to
live
in
grew
thinner
than
they
were
before
for
sheer
vexation
when
they
heard
me
it
was
thus
that
the
flea
and
the
grasshopper
gave
an
account
of
themselves

quite
good
enough
to
marry
a
princess
the
leap-frog
said
nothing
but
people
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
he
therefore
thought
the
more
and
when
the
housedog
snuffed
at
him
with
his
nose
he
confessed
the
leap-frog
was
of
good
family
the
old
councillor
who
had
had
three
orders
given
him
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
asserted
that
the
leap-frog
was
a
prophet
for
that
one
could
see
on
his
back
if
there
would
be
a
severe
or
mild
winter
and
that
was
what
one
could
not
see
even
on
the
back
of
the
man
who
writes
the
almanac
i
say
nothing
it
is
true
exclaimed
the
king
but
i
have
my
own
opinion
notwithstanding
now
the
trial
was
to
take
place
the
flea
jumped
so
high
that
nobody
could
see
where
he
went
to
so
they
all
asserted
he
had
not
jumped
at
all
and
that
was
dishonorable
the
grasshopper
jumped
only
half
as
high
but
he
leaped
into
the
king’s
face
who
said
that
was
ill
mannered
the
leap-frog
stood
still
for
a
long
time
lost
in
thought
it
was
believed
at
last
he
would
not
jump
at
all
i
only
hope
he
is
not
unwell
said
the
house-dog
when
pop
he
made
a
jump
all
on
one
side
into
the
lap
of
the
princess
who
was
sitting
on
a
little
golden
stool
close
by
hereupon
the
king
said
there
is
nothing
above
my
daughter
therefore
to
bound
up
to
her
is
the
highest
jump
that
can
be
made
but
for
this
one
must
possess
understanding
and
the
leap-frog
has
shown
that
he
has
understanding
he
is
brave
and
intellectual
and
so
he
won
the
princess
it’s
all
the
same
to
me
said
the
flea
she
may
have
the
old
leap-frog
for
all
i
care
i
jumped
the
highest
but
in
this
world
merit
seldom
meets
its
reward
a
fine
exterior
is
what
people
look
at
now
a-days
the
flea
then
went
into
foreign
service
where
it
is
said
he
was
killed
the
grasshopper
sat
without
on
a
green
bank
and
reflected
on
worldly
things
and
he
said
too
yes
a
fine
exterior
is
everything—a
fine
exterior
is
what
people
care
about
and
then
he
began
chirping
his
peculiar
melancholy
song
from
which
we
have
taken
this
history

which
may
very
possibly
be
all

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
boy
who
had
taken
cold
he
had
gone
out
and
got
his
feet
wet
though
nobody
could
imagine
how
it
had
happened
for
it
was
quite
dry
weather
so
his
mother
undressed
him
put
him
to
bed
and
had
the
tea-pot
brought
in
to
make
him
a
good
cup
of
elderflower
tea
just
at
that
moment
the
merry
old
man
came
in
who
lived
up
a-top
of
the
house
all
alone
for
he
had
neither
wife
nor
children—but
he
liked
children
very
much
and
knew
so
many
fairy
tales
that
it
was
quite
delightful
now
drink
your
tea
said
the
boy’s
mother
then
perhaps
you
may
hear
a
fairy
tale
if
i
had
but
something
new
to
tell
said
the
old
man
but
how
did
the
child
get
his
feet
wet
that
is
the
very
thing
that
nobody
can
make
out
said
his
mother
am
i
to
hear
a
fairy
tale
asked
the
little
boy
yes
if
you
can
tell
me
exactly—for
i
must
know
that
first—how
deep
the
gutter
is
in
the
little
street
opposite
that
you
pass
through
in
going
to
school
just
up
to
the
middle
of
my
boot
said
the
child
but
then
i
must
go
into
the
deep
hole
ah
ah
that’s
where
the
wet
feet
came
from
said
the
old
man
i
ought
now
to
tell
you
a
story
but
i
don’t
know
any
more
you
can
make
one
in
a
moment
said
the
little
boy
my
mother
says
that
all
you
look
at
can
be
turned
into
a
fairy
tale
and
that
you
can
find
a
story
in
everything
yes
but
such
tales
and
stories
are
good
for
nothing
the
right
sort
come
of
themselves
they
tap
at
my
forehead
and
say
‘here
we
are.’
won’t
there
be
a
tap
soon
asked
the
little
boy
and
his
mother
laughed
put
some
elder-flowers
in
the
tea-pot
and
poured
boiling
water
upon
them
do
tell
me
something
pray
do
yes
if
a
fairy
tale
would
come
of
its
own
accord
but
they
are
proud
and
haughty
and
come
only
when
they
choose
stop
said
he
all
on
a
sudden
i
have
it
pay
attention
there
is
one
in
the
tea
pot
and
the
little
boy
looked
at
the
tea-pot
the
cover
rose
more
and
more
and
the
elder-flowers
came
forth
so
fresh
and
white
and
shot
up
long
branches
out
of
the
spout
even
did
they
spread
themselves
on
all
sides
and
grew
larger

larger
it
was
a
splendid
elderbush
a

tree
and
it
reached
into

bed
and
pushed
the
curtains
aside
how
it
bloomed
and
what
an
odour
in
the
middle
of
the
bush
sat
a
friendly-looking
old
woman
in
a
most
strange
dress
it
was
quite
green
like
the
leaves
of
the
elder
and
was
trimmed
with

white
elder-flowers

that

could
not

the

that
we

not

just
such
another
large
blooming
elder
tree
stands
near
the
new
booths
it
grew
there
in
the
corner
of
a
little
miserable
court-yard
and
under
it
sat
of
an
afternoon
in
the
most
splendid
sunshine
two
old
people
an
old
old
seaman
and
his
old
old
wife
they
had
great-grand-children
and
were
soon
to
celebrate
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
their
marriage
but
they
could
not
exactly
recollect
the
date
and
old
granny
sat
in
the
tree
and
looked
as
pleased
as
now
‘i
know
the
date,’
said
she
but
those
below
did
not
hear
her
for
they
were
talking
about
old
times
‘yes
can’t
you
remember
when
we
were
very
little,’
said
the
old
seaman
‘and
ran
and
played
about
it
was
the
very
same
court-yard
where
we
now
are
and
we
stuck
slips
in
the
ground
and
made
a
garden.’
‘i
remember
it
well,’
said
the
old
woman
‘i
remember
it
quite
well
we
watered
the
slips
and
one
of
them
was
an
elderbush
it
took
root
put
forth
green
shoots
and
grew
up
to
be
the
large
tree
under
which
we
old
folks
are
now
sitting.’
‘to
be
sure,’
said
he
‘and
there
in
the
corner
stood
a
waterpail
where
i
used
to
swim
my
boats.’
‘true
but
first
we
went
to
school
to
learn
somewhat,’
said
she
‘and
then
we
were
confirmed
we
both
cried
but
in
the
afternoon
we
went
up
the
round
tower
and
looked
down
on
copenhagen
and
far
far
away
over
the
water
then
we
went
to
friedericksberg
where
the
king
and
the
queen
were
sailing
about
in
their
splendid
barges.’
‘but
i
had
a
different
sort
of
sailing
to
that
later
and
that
too
for
many
a
year
a
long
way
off
on
great
voyages.’
‘yes
many
a
time
have
i
wept
for
your
sake,’
said
she
‘i
thought
you
were
dead
and
gone
and
lying
down
in
the
deep
waters
many
a
night
have
i
got
up
to
see
if
the
wind
had
not
changed
and
changed
it
had
sure
enough
but
you
never
came
i
remember
so
well
one
day
when
the
rain
was
pouring
down
in
torrents
the
scavengers
were
before
the
house
where
i
was
in
service
and
i
had
come
up
with
the
dust
and
remained
standing
at
the
door—it
was
dreadful
weather—when
just
as
i
was
there
the
postman
came
and
gave
me
a
letter
it
was
from
you
what
a
tour
that
letter
had
made
i
opened
it
instantly
and
read
i
laughed
and
wept
i
was
so
happy
in
it
i
read
that
you
were
in
warm
lands
where
the
coffee-tree
grows
what
a
blessed
land
that
must
be
you
related
so
much
and
i
saw
it
all
the
while
the
rain
was
pouring
down
and
i
standing
there
with
the
dust-box
at
the
same
moment
came
someone
who
embraced
me.’
‘yes
but
you
gave
him
a
good
box
on
his
ear
that
made
it
tingle!’
‘but
i
did
not
know
it
was
you
you
arrived
as
soon
as
your
letter
and
you
were
so
handsome
that
you
still
are—and
had
a
long
yellow
silk
handkerchief
round
your
neck
and
a
bran
new
hat
on
oh
you
were
so
dashing
good
heavens
what
weather
it
was
and
what
a
state
the
street
was
in!’
‘and
then
we
married,’
said
he
‘don’t
you
remember
and
then
we
had
our
first
little
boy
and
then
mary
and
nicholas
and
peter
and
christian.’
‘yes
and
how
they
all
grew
up
to
be
honest
people
and
were
beloved
by
everybody.’
‘and
their

also
have
children,’
said

sailor
‘yes

are

able
to
remember
all
that
had
happened
many
years
ago
and
the
elderbush
sent
forth
a
strong
odour
in
the
sun
that
was
just
about
to
set
and
shone
right
in
the
old
people’s
faces
they
both
looked
so
rosy-cheeked
and
the
youngest
of
the
grandchildren
danced
around
them
and
called
out
quite
delighted
that
there
was
to
be
something
very
splendid
that
evening—they
were
all
to
have
hot
potatoes
and
old
nanny
nodded
in
the
bush
and
shouted
‘hurrah!’
with
the
rest
but
that
is
no
fairy
tale
said
the
little
boy
who
was
listening
to
the
story
the
thing
is
you
must
understand
it
said
the
narrator
let
us
ask
old
nanny
that
was
no
fairy
tale
‘tis
true
said
old
nanny
but
now
it’s
coming
the
most
wonderful
fairy
tales
grow
out
of
that
which
is
reality
were
that
not
the
case
you
know
my
magnificent
elderbush
could
not
have
grown
out
of
the
tea-pot
and
then
she
took
the
little
boy
out
of
bed
laid
him
on
her
bosom
and
the
branches
of
the
elder
tree
full
of
flowers
closed
around
her
they
sat
in
an
aerial
dwelling
and
it
flew
with
them
through
the
air
oh
it
was
wondrous
beautiful
old
nanny
had
grown
all
of
a
sudden
a
young
and
pretty
maiden
but
her
robe
was
still
the
same
green
stuff
with
white
flowers
which
she
had
worn
before
on
her
bosom
she
had
a
real
elderflower
and
in
her
yellow
waving
hair
a
wreath
of
the
flowers
her
eyes
were
so
large
and
blue
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
at
them
she
kissed
the
boy
and
now
they
were
of
the
same
age
and
felt
alike
hand
in
hand
they
went
out
of
the
bower
and
they
were
standing
in
the
beautiful
garden
of
their
home
near
the
green
lawn
papa’s
walking-stick
was
tied
and
for
the
little
ones
it
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
life
for
as
soon
as
they
got
astride
it
the
round
polished
knob
was
turned
into
a
magnificent
neighing
head
a
long
black
mane
fluttered
in
the
breeze
and
four
slender
yet
strong
legs
shot
out
the
animal
was
strong
and
handsome
and
away
they
went
at
full
gallop
round
the
lawn
huzza
now
we
are
riding
miles
off
said
the
boy
we
are
riding
away
to
the
castle
where
we
were
last
year
and
on
they
rode
round
the
grass-plot
and
the
little
maiden
who
we
know
was
no
one
else
but
old
nanny
kept
on
crying
out
now
we
are
in
the
country
don’t
you
see
the
farm-house
yonder
and
there
is
an
elder
tree
standing
beside
it
and
the
cock
is
scraping
away
the
earth
for
the
hens
look
how
he
struts
and
now
we
are
close
to
the
church
it
lies
high
upon
the
hill
between
the
large
oak-trees
one
of
which
is
half
decayed
and
now
we
are
by
the
smithy
where
the
fire
is
blazing
and
where
the
half-naked
men
are
banging
with
their
hammers
till
the
sparks
fly
about
away
away
to
the
beautiful
country-seat
and
all
that
the
little
maiden
who
sat
behind
on
the
stick
spoke
of
flew
by
in
reality
the
boy
saw
it
all
and
yet
they
were
only
going
round
the
grass-plot
then
they
played
in
a
side
avenue
and
marked
out
a
little
garden
on
the
earth
and
they
took
elder-blossoms
from
their
hair
planted
them
and
they
grew
just
like
those
the
old
people
planted
when
they
were
children
as
related
before
they
went
hand
in
hand
as
the
old
people
had
done
when
they
were
children
but
not
to
the
round
tower
or
to
friedericksberg
no
the
little
damsel
wound
her
arms
round
the
boy
and
then
they
flew
far
away
through
all
denmark
and
spring
came
and
summer
and
then
it
was
autumn
and
then
winter
and
a
thousand
pictures
were
reflected
in
the
eye
and
in
the
heart
of
the
boy
and
the
little
girl
always
sang
to
him
this
you
will
never
forget
and
during
their
whole
flight
the
elder
tree
smelt
so
sweet
and
odorous
he
remarked
the
roses
and
the
fresh
beeches
but
the
elder
tree
had
a
more
wondrous
fragrance
for
its
flowers
hung
on
the
breast
of
the
little
maiden
and
there
too
did
he
often
lay
his
head
during
the
flight
it
is
lovely
here
in
spring
said
the
young
maiden
and
they
stood
in
a
beech-wood
that
had
just
put
on
its
first
green
where
the
woodroof
at
their
feet
sent
forth
its
fragrance

looked
so
pretty

oh
would
it
were
always
spring
in
the
sweetly
smelling
danish
beech-forests
asperula
odorata
it
is
lovely
here
in
summer
said
she
and
she
flew
past
old
castles
of
by-gone
days
of
chivalry
where
the
red
walls
and
the
embattled
gables
were
mirrored
in
the
canal
where
the
swans
were
swimming
and
peered
up
into
the
old
cool
avenues
in
the
fields
the
corn
was
waving
like
the
sea
in
the
ditches
red
and
yellow
flowers
were
growing
while
wild-drone
flowers
and
blooming
convolvuluses
were
creeping
in
the
hedges
and
towards
evening
the
moon
rose
round
and
large
and
the
haycocks
in
the
meadows
smelt
so
sweetly
this
one
never
forgets
it
is
lovely
here
in
autumn
said
the
little
maiden
and
suddenly
the
atmosphere
grew
as
blue
again
as
before
the
forest
grew
red
and
green
and
yellow-colored
the
dogs
came
leaping
along
and
whole
flocks
of
wild-fowl
flew
over
the
cairn
where
blackberry-bushes
were
hanging
round
the
old
stones
the
sea
was
dark
blue
covered
with
ships
full
of
white
sails
and
in
the
barn
old
women
maidens
and
children
were
sitting
picking
hops
into
a
large
cask
the
young
sang
songs
but
the
old
told
fairy
tales
of
mountain-sprites
and
soothsayers
nothing
could
be
more
charming
it
is
delightful
here
in
winter
said
the
little
maiden
and
all
the
trees
were
covered
with
hoar
frost
they
looked
like
white
corals
the
snow
crackled
under
foot
as
if
one
had
new
boots
on
and
one
falling
star
after
the
other
was
seen
in
the
sky
the
christmas-tree
was
lighted
in
the
room
presents
were
there
and
good-humor
reigned
in
the
country
the
violin
sounded
in
the
room
of
the
peasant
the
newly-baked
cakes
were
attacked
even
the
poorest
child
said
it
is
really
delightful
here
in
winter
yes
it
was
delightful
and
the
little
maiden
showed
the
boy
everything
and
the
elder
tree
still
was
fragrant
and
the
red
flag
with
the
white
cross
was
still
waving
the
flag
under
which
the
old
seaman
in
the
new
booths
had
sailed
and
the
boy
grew
up
to
be
a
lad
and
was
to
go
forth
in
the
wide
world-far
far
away
to
warm
lands
where
the
coffee-tree
grows
but
at
his
departure
the
little
maiden
took
an
elder-blossom
from
her
bosom
and
gave
it
him
to
keep
and
it
was
placed
between
the
leaves
of
his
prayer-book
and
when
in
foreign
lands
he
opened
the
book
it
was
always
at
the
place
where
the
keepsake-flower
lay
and
the
more
he
looked
at
it
the
fresher
it
became
he
felt
as
it
were
the
fragrance
of
the
danish
groves
and
from
among
the
leaves
of
the
flowers
he
could
distinctly
see
the
little
maiden
peeping
forth
with
her
bright
blue
eyes—and
then
she
whispered
it
is
delightful
here
in
spring
summer
autumn
and
winter
and
a
hundred
visions
glided
before
his
mind
thus
passed
many
years
and
he
was
now
an
old
man
and
sat
with
his
old
wife
under
the
blooming
tree
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
as
the
old
grand-father
and
grand-mother
yonder
in
the
new
booths
did
and
they
talked
exactly
like
them
of
old
times
and
of
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
their
wedding
the
little
maiden
with
the
blue
eyes
and
with
elder-blossoms
in
her
hair
sat
in
the
tree
nodded
to
both
of
them
and
said
to-day
is
the
fiftieth
anniversary
and
then
she
took
two
flowers
out
of
her
hair
and
kissed
them
first
they
shone
like
silver
then
like
gold
and
when
they
laid
them
on
the
heads
of
the
old
people
each
flower
became
a
golden
crown
so
there
they
both
sat
like
a
king
and
a
queen
under
the
fragrant
tree
that
looked
exactly
like
an
elder
the
old
man
told
his
wife
the
story
of
old
nanny
as
it
had
been
told
him
when
a
boy
and
it
seemed
to
both
of
them
it
contained
much
that
resembled
their
own
history
and
those
parts
that
were
like
it
pleased
them
best
thus
it
is
said
the
little
maiden
in
the
tree

call
me
‘old

others
a
‘dryad,’

me
see
if

still
and
the

man
opened
his

lay
the
elder-blossom
as
fresh
as
if
it
had
been
placed
there
but
a
short
time
before
and

the

with

in

they

the
bell
people
said
the
evening
bell
is
sounding
the
sun
is
setting
for
a
strange
wondrous
tone
was
heard
in
the
narrow
streets
of
a
large
town
it
was
like
the
sound
of
a
church-bell
but
it
was
only
heard
for
a
moment
for
the
rolling
of
the
carriages
and
the
voices
of
the
multitude
made
too
great
a
noise
those
persons
who
were
walking
outside
the
town
where
the
houses
were
farther
apart
with
gardens
or
little
fields
between
them
could
see
the
evening
sky
still
better
and
heard
the
sound
of
the
bell
much
more
distinctly
it
was
as
if
the
tones
came
from
a
church
in
the
still
forest
people
looked
thitherward
and
felt
their
minds
attuned
most
solemnly
a
long
time
passed
and
people
said
to
each
other—“i
wonder
if
there
is
a
church
out
in
the
wood
the
bell
has
a
tone
that
is
wondrous
sweet
let
us
stroll
thither
and
examine
the
matter
nearer
and
the
rich
people
drove
out
and
the
poor
walked
but
the
way
seemed
strangely
long
to
them
and
when
they
came
to
a
clump
of
willows
which
grew
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
they
sat
down
and
looked
up
at
the
long
branches
and
fancied
they
were
now
in
the
depth
of
the
green
wood
the
confectioner
of
the
town
came
out
and
set
up
his
booth
there
and
soon
after
came
another
confectioner
who
hung
a
bell
over
his
stand
as
a
sign
or
ornament
but
it
had
no
clapper
and
it
was
tarred
over
to
preserve
it
from
the
rain
when
all
the
people
returned
home
they
said
it
had
been
very
romantic
and
that
it
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
to
a
pic-nic
or
tea-party
there
were
three
persons
who
asserted
they
had
penetrated
to
the
end
of
the
forest
and
that
they
had
always
heard
the
wonderful
sounds
of
the
bell
but
it
had
seemed
to
them
as
if
it
had
come
from
the
town
one
wrote
a
whole
poem
about
it
and
said
the
bell
sounded
like
the
voice
of
a
mother
to
a
good
dear
child
and
that
no
melody
was
sweeter
than
the
tones
of
the
bell
the
king
of
the
country
was
also
observant
of
it
and
vowed
that
he
who
could
discover
whence
the
sounds
proceeded
should
have
the
title
of
universal
bell-ringer
even
if
it
were
not
really
a
bell
many
persons
now
went
to
the
wood
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
place
but
one
only
returned
with
a
sort
of
explanation
for
nobody
went
far
enough
that
one
not
further
than
the
others
however
he
said
that
the
sound
proceeded
from
a
very
large
owl
in
a
hollow
tree
a
sort
of
learned
owl
that
continually
knocked
its
head
against
the
branches
but
whether
the
sound
came
from
his
head
or
from
the
hollow
tree
that
no
one
could
say
with
certainty
so
now
he
got
the
place
of
universal
bell-ringer
and
wrote
yearly
a
short
treatise
on
the
owl
but
everybody
was
just
as
wise
as
before
it
was
the
day
of
confirmation
the
clergyman
had
spoken
so
touchingly
the
children
who
were
confirmed
had
been
greatly
moved
it
was
an
eventful
day
for
them
from
children
they
become
all
at
once
grown-up-persons
it
was
as
if
their
infant
souls
were
now
to
fly
all
at
once
into
persons
with
more
understanding
the
sun
was
shining
gloriously
the
children
that
had
been
confirmed
went
out
of
the
town
and
from
the
wood
was
borne
towards
them
the
sounds
of
the
unknown
bell
with
wonderful
distinctness
they
all
immediately
felt
a
wish
to
go
thither
all
except
three
one
of
them
had
to
go
home
to
try
on
a
ball-dress
for
it
was
just
the
dress
and
the
ball
which
had
caused
her
to
be
confirmed
this
time
for
otherwise
she
would
not
have
come
the
other
was
a
poor
boy
who
had
borrowed
his
coat
and
boots
to
be
confirmed
in
from
the
innkeeper’s
son
and
he
was
to
give
them
back
by
a
certain
hour
the
third
said
that
he
never
went
to
a
strange
place
if
his
parents
were
not
with
him—that
he
had
always
been
a
good
boy
hitherto
and
would
still
be
so
now
that
he
was
confirmed
and
that
one
ought
not
to
laugh
at
him
for
it
the
others
however
did
make
fun
of
him

there
were
three
therefore
that
did
not
go
the
others
hastened
on
the
sun
shone
the
birds
sang
and
the
children
sang
too
and
each
held
the
other
by
the
hand
for
as
yet
they
had
none
of
them
any
high
office
and
were
all
of
equal
rank
in
the
eye
of
god
but
two
of
the
youngest
soon
grew
tired
and
both
returned
to
town
two
little
girls
sat
down
and
twined
garlands
so
they
did
not
go
either
and
when
the
others
reached
the
willow-tree
where
the
confectioner
was
they
said
now
we
are
there
in
reality
the
bell
does
not
exist
it
is
only
a
fancy
that
people
have
taken
into
their
heads
at
the
same
moment
the
bell
sounded
deep
in
the
wood
so
clear
and
solemnly
that
five
or
six
determined
to
penetrate
somewhat
further
it
was
so
thick
and
the
foliage
so
dense
that
it
was
quite
fatiguing
to
proceed
woodroof
and
anemonies
grew
almost
too
high
blooming
convolvuluses
and
blackberry-bushes
hung
in
long
garlands
from
tree
to
tree
where
the
nightingale
sang
and
the
sunbeams
were
playing
it
was
very
beautiful
but
it
was
no
place
for
girls
to
go
their
clothes
would
get
so
torn
large
blocks
of
stone
lay
there
overgrown
with
moss
of
every
color
the
fresh
spring
bubbled
forth
and
made
a
strange
gurgling
sound
that
surely
cannot
be
the
bell
said
one
of
the
children
lying
down
and
listening
this
must
be
looked
to
so
he
remained
and
let
the
others
go
on
without
him
they
afterwards
came
to
a
little
house
made
of
branches
and
the
bark
of
trees
a
large
wild
apple
tree
bent
over
it
as
if
it
would
shower
down
all
its
blessings
on
the
roof
where
roses
were
blooming
the
long
stems
twined
round
the
gable
on
which
there
hung
a
small
bell
was
it
that
which
people
had
heard
yes
everybody
was
unanimous
on
the
subject
except
one
who
said
that
the
bell
was
too
small
and
too
fine
to
be
heard
at
so
great
a
distance
and
besides
it
was
very
different
tones
to
those
that
could
move
a
human
heart
in
such
a
manner
it
was
a
king’s
son
who
spoke
whereon
the
others
said
such
people
always
want
to
be
wiser
than
everybody
else
they
now
let
him
go
on
alone
and
as
he
went
his
breast
was
filled
more
and
more
with
the
forest
solitude
but
he
still
heard
the
little
bell
with
which
the
others
were
so
satisfied
and
now
and
then
when
the
wind
blew
he
could
also
hear
the
people
singing
who
were
sitting
at
tea
where
the
confectioner
had
his
tent
but
the
deep
sound
of
the
bell
rose
louder
it
was
almost
as
if
an
organ
were
accompanying
it
and
the
tones
came
from
the
left
hand
the
side
where
the
heart
is
placed
a
rustling
was
heard
in
the
bushes
and
a
little
boy
stood
before
the
king’s
son
a
boy
in
wooden
shoes
and
with
so
short
a
jacket
that
one
could
see
what
long
wrists
he
had
both
knew
each
other
the
boy
was
that
one
among
the
children
who
could
not
come
because
he
had
to
go
home
and
return
his
jacket
and
boots
to
the
innkeeper’s
son
this
he
had
done
and
was
now
going
on
in
wooden
shoes
and
in
his
humble
dress
for
the
bell
sounded
with
so
deep
a
tone
and
with
such
strange
power
that
proceed
he
must
why
then
we
can
go
together
said
the
king’s
son
but
the
poor
child
that
had
been
confirmed
was
quite
ashamed
he
looked
at
his
wooden
shoes
pulled
at
the
short
sleeves
of
his
jacket
and
said
that
he
was
afraid
he
could
not
walk
so
fast
besides
he
thought
that
the
bell
must
be
looked
for
to
the
right
for
that
was
the
place
where
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
were
to
be
found
but
there
we
shall
not
meet
said
the
king’s
son
nodding
at
the
same
time
to
the
poor
boy
who
went
into
the
darkest
thickest
part
of
the
wood
where
thorns
tore
his
humble
dress
and
scratched
his
face
and
hands
and
feet
till
they
bled
the
king’s
son
got
some
scratches
too
but
the
sun
shone
on
his
path
and
it
is
him
that
we
will
follow
for
he
was
an
excellent
and
resolute
youth
i
must
and
will
find
the
bell
said
he
even
if
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
the
end

the
ugly
apes
sat
upon
the
trees
and
grinned
shall
we
thrash
him
said
they
shall
we
thrash
him
he
is
the
son
of
a
king
but
on
he
went
without
being
disheartened
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
where
the
most
wonderful
flowers
were
growing
there
stood
white
lilies
with
blood-red
stamina
skyblue
tulips
which
shone
as
they
waved
in
the
winds
and
apple-trees
the
apples
of
which
looked
exactly
like
large
soapbubbles
so
only
think
how
the
trees
must
have
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
around
the
nicest
green
meads
where
the
deer
were
playing
in
the
grass
grew
magnificent
oaks
and
beeches
and
if
the
bark
of
one
of
the
trees
was
cracked
there
grass
and
long
creeping
plants
grew
in
the
crevices
and
there
were
large
calm
lakes
there
too
in
which
white
swans
were
swimming
and
beat
the
air
with
their
wings
the
king’s
son
often
stood
still
and
listened
he
thought
the
bell
sounded
from
the
depths
of
these
still
lakes
but
then
he
remarked
again
that
the
tone
proceeded
not
from
there
but
farther
off
from
out
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
sun
now
set
the
atmosphere
glowed
like
fire
it
was
still
in
the
woods
so
very
still
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
sung
his
evening
hymn
and
said
i
cannot
find
what
i
seek
the
sun
is
going
down
and
night
is
coming—the
dark
dark
night
yet
perhaps
i
may
be
able
once
more
to
see
the
round
red
sun
before
he
entirely
disappears
i
will
climb
up
yonder
rock
and
he
seized
hold
of
the
creeping-plants
and
the
roots
of
trees—climbed
up
the
moist
stones
where
the
water-snakes
were
writhing
and
the
toads
were
croaking—and
he
gained
the
summit
before
the
sun
had
quite
gone
down
how
magnificent
was
the
sight
from
this
height
the
sea—the
great
the
glorious
sea
that
dashed
its
long
waves
against
the
coast—was
stretched
out
before
him
and
yonder
where
sea
and
sky
meet
stood
the
sun
like
a
large
shining
altar
all
melted
together
in
the
most
glowing
colors
and
the
wood
and
the
sea
sang
a
song
of
rejoicing
and
his
heart
sang
with
the
rest

vast

the

itself

out

spot
just

soon

the
old
house
in
the
street
up
there
was
an
old
a
very
old
house—it
was
almost
three
hundred
years
old
for
that
might
be
known
by
reading
the
great
beam
on
which
the
date
of
the
year
was
carved
together
with
tulips
and
hop-binds
there
were
whole
verses
spelled
as
in
former
times
and
over
every
window
was
a
distorted
face
cut
out
in
the
beam
the
one
story
stood
forward
a
great
way
over
the
other
and
directly
under
the
eaves
was
a
leaden
spout
with
a
dragon’s
head
the
rain-water
should
have
run
out
of
the
mouth
but
it
ran
out
of
the
belly
for
there
was
a
hole
in
the
spout
all
the
other
houses
in
the
street
were
so
new
and
so
neat
with
large
window
panes
and
smooth
walls
one
could
easily
see
that
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
old
house
they
certainly
thought
how
long
is
that
old
decayed
thing
to
stand
here
as
a
spectacle
in
the
street
and
then
the
projecting
windows
stand
so
far
out
that
no
one
can
see
from
our
windows
what
happens
in
that
direction
the
steps
are
as
broad
as
those
of
a
palace
and
as
high
as
to
a
church
tower
the
iron
railings
look
just
like
the
door
to
an
old
family
vault
and
then
they
have
brass
tops—that’s
so
stupid
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
were
also
new
and
neat
houses
and
they
thought
just
as
the
others
did
but
at
the
window
opposite
the
old
house
there
sat
a
little
boy
with
fresh
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
beaming
eyes
he
certainly
liked
the
old
house
best
and
that
both
in
sunshine
and
moonshine
and
when
he
looked
across
at
the
wall
where
the
mortar
had
fallen
out
he
could
sit
and
find
out
there
the
strangest
figures
imaginable
exactly
as
the
street
had
appeared
before
with
steps
projecting
windows
and
pointed
gables
he
could
see
soldiers
with
halberds
and
spouts
where
the
water
ran
like
dragons
and
serpents
that
was
a
house
to
look
at
and
there
lived
an
old
man
who
wore
plush
breeches
and
he
had
a
coat
with
large
brass
buttons
and
a
wig
that
one
could
see
was
a
real
wig
every
morning
there
came
an
old
fellow
to
him
who
put
his
rooms
in
order
and
went
on
errands
otherwise
the
old
man
in
the
plush
breeches
was
quite
alone
in
the
old
house
now
and
then
he
came
to
the
window
and
looked
out
and
the
little
boy
nodded
to
him
and
the
old
man
nodded
again
and
so
they
became
acquaintances
and
then
they
were
friends
although
they
had
never
spoken
to
each
other—but
that
made
no
difference
the
little
boy
heard
his
parents
say
the
old
man
opposite
is
very
well
off
but
he
is
so
very
very
lonely
the
sunday
following
the
little
boy
took
something
and
wrapped
it
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
went
downstairs
and
stood
in
the
doorway
and
when
the
man
who
went
on
errands
came
past
he
said
to
him
i
say
master
will
you
give
this
to
the
old
man
over
the
way
from
me
i
have
two
pewter
soldiers
this
is
one
of
them
and
he
shall
have
it
for
i
know
he
is
so
very
very
lonely
and
the
old
errand
man
looked
quite
pleased
nodded
and
took
the
pewter
soldier
over
to
the
old
house
afterwards
there
came
a
message
it
was
to
ask
if
the
little
boy
himself
had
not
a
wish
to
come
over
and
pay
a
visit
and
so
he
got
permission
of
his
parents
and
then
went
over
to
the
old
house
and
the
brass
balls
on
the
iron
railings
shone
much
brighter
than
ever
one
would
have
thought
they
were
polished
on
account
of
the
visit
and
it
was
as
if
the
carved-out
trumpeters—for
there
were
trumpeters
who
stood
in
tulips
carved
out
on
the
door—blew
with
all
their
might
their
cheeks
appeared
so
much
rounder
than
before
yes
they
blew—“trateratra
the
little
boy
comes
trateratra!”—and
then
the
door
opened
the
whole
passage
was
hung
with
portraits
of
knights
in
armor
and
ladies
in

gowns

armor
rattled
and
the
silken
gowns
rustled
and
then
there
was
a
flight
of
stairs
which
went
a
good
way
upwards
and
a
little
way
downwards
and
then
one
came
on
a
balcony
which
was
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
sure
enough
with
large
holes
and
long
crevices
but
grass
grew
there
and
leaves
out
of
them
altogether
for
the
whole
balcony
outside
the
yard
and
the
walls
were
overgrown
with
so
much
green
stuff
that
it
looked
like
a
garden
only
a
balcony
here
stood
old
flower-pots
with
faces
and
asses’
ears
and
the
flowers
grew
just
as
they
liked
one
of
the
pots
was
quite
overrun
on
all
sides
with
pinks
that
is
to
say
with
the
green
part
shoot
stood
by
shoot
and
it
said
quite
distinctly
the
air
has
cherished
me
the
sun
has
kissed
me
and
promised
me
a
little
flower
on
sunday
a
little
flower
on
sunday
and
then
they
entered
a
chamber
where
the
walls
were
covered
with
hog’s
leather
and
printed
with
gold
flowers
the
gilding
decays
but
hog’s
leather
stays
said
the
walls
and
there
stood
easy-chairs
with
such
high
backs
and
so
carved
out
and
with
arms
on
both
sides
sit
down
sit
down
said
they
ugh
how
i
creak
now
i
shall
certainly
get
the
gout
like
the
old
clothespress
ugh
and
then
the
little
boy
came
into
the
room
where
the
projecting
windows
were
and
where
the
old
man
sat
i
thank
you
for
the
pewter
soldier
my
little
friend
said
the
old
man
and
i
thank
you
because
you
come
over
to
me
thankee
thankee
or
cranky
cranky
sounded
from
all
the
furniture
there
was
so
much
of
it
that
each
article
stood
in
the
other’s
way
to
get
a
look
at
the
little
boy
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
hung
a
picture
representing
a
beautiful
lady
so
young
so
glad
but
dressed
quite
as
in
former
times
with
clothes
that
stood
quite
stiff
and
with
powder
in
her
hair
she
neither
said
thankee
thankee
nor
cranky
cranky
but
looked
with
her
mild
eyes
at
the
little
boy
who
directly
asked
the
old
man
where
did
you
get
her
yonder
at
the
broker’s
said
the
old
man
where
there
are
so
many
pictures
hanging
no
one
knows
or
cares
about
them
for
they
are
all
of
them
buried
but
i
knew
her
in
by-gone
days
and
now
she
has
been
dead
and
gone
these
fifty
years
under
the
picture
in
a
glazed
frame
there
hung
a
bouquet
of
withered
flowers
they
were
almost
fifty
years
old
they
looked
so
very
old
the
pendulum
of
the
great
clock
went
to
and
fro
and
the
hands
turned
and
everything
in
the
room
became
still
older
but
they
did
not
observe
it
they
say
at
home
said
the
little
boy
that
you
are
so
very
very
lonely
oh
said
he
the
old
thoughts
with
what
they
may
bring
with
them
come
and
visit
me
and
now
you
also
come
i
am
very
well
off
then
he
took
a
book
with
pictures
in
it
down
from
the
shelf
there
were
whole
long
processions
and
pageants
with
the
strangest
characters
which
one
never
sees
now-a-days
soldiers
like
the
knave
of
clubs
and
citizens
with
waving
flags
the
tailors
had
theirs
with
a

of
shears
held
by

lions
and
the

theirs
without

with

little
boy
i
find
it
so
very
delightful
here
and
then
all
the
old
thoughts
with
what
they
may
bring
with
them
they
come
and
visit
here
yes
it’s
all
very
well
but
i
see
nothing
of
them
and
i
don’t
know
them
said
the
pewter
soldier
i
cannot
bear
it
but
you
must
said
the
little
boy
then
in
came
the
old
man
with
the
most
pleased
and
happy
face
the
most
delicious
preserves
apples
and
nuts
and
so
the
little
boy
thought
no
more
about
the
pewter
soldier
the
little
boy
returned
home
happy
and
pleased
and
weeks
and
days
passed
away
and
nods
were
made
to
the
old
house
and
from
the
old
house
and
then
the
little
boy
went
over
there
again
the
carved
trumpeters
blew
trateratra
there
is
the
little
boy
trateratra
and
the
swords
and
armor
on
the
knights’
portraits
rattled
and
the
silk
gowns
rustled
the
hog’s
leather
spoke
and
the
old
chairs
had
the
gout
in
their
legs
and
rheumatism
in
their
backs
ugh
it
was
exactly
like
the
first
time
for
over
there
one
day
and
hour
was
just
like
another
i
cannot
bear
it
said
the
pewter
soldier
i
have
shed
pewter
tears
it
is
too
melancholy
rather
let
me
go
to
the
wars
and
lose
arms
and
legs
it
would
at
least
be
a
change
i
cannot
bear
it
longer
now
i
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
visit
from
one’s
old
thoughts
with
what
they
may
bring
with
them
i
have
had
a
visit
from
mine
and
you
may
be
sure
it
is
no
pleasant
thing
in
the
end
i
was
at
last
about
to
jump
down
from
the
drawers
i
saw
you
all
over
there
at
home
so
distinctly
as
if
you
really
were
here
it
was
again
that
sunday
morning
all
you
children
stood
before
the
table
and
sung
your
psalms
as
you
do
every
morning
you
stood
devoutly
with
folded
hands
and
father
and
mother
were
just
as
pious
and
then
the
door
was
opened
and
little
sister
mary
who
is
not
two
years
old
yet
and
who
always
dances
when
she
hears
music
or
singing
of
whatever
kind
it
may
be
was
put
into
the
room—though
she
ought
not
to
have
been
there—and
then
she
began
to
dance
but
could
not
keep
time
because
the
tones
were
so
long
and
then
she
stood
first
on
the
one
leg
and
bent
her
head
forwards
and
then
on
the
other
leg
and
bent
her
head
forwards—but
all
would
not
do
you
stood
very
seriously
all
together
although
it
was
difficult
enough
but
i
laughed
to
myself
and
then
i
fell
off
the
table
and
got
a
bump
which
i
have
still—for
it
was
not
right
of
me
to
laugh
but
the
whole
now
passes
before
me
again
in
thought
and
everything
that
i
have
lived
to
see
and
these
are
the
old
thoughts
with
what
they
may
bring
with
them
tell
me
if
you
still
sing
on
sundays
tell
me
something
about
little
mary
and
how
my
comrade
the
other
pewter
soldier
lives
yes
he
is
happy
enough
that’s
sure
i
cannot
bear
it
any
longer
you
are
given
away
as
a
present

the
old
man
now
came
with
a
drawer
in
which
there
was
much
to
be
seen
both
tin
boxes
and
balsam
boxes
old
cards
so
large
and
so
gilded
such
as
one
never
sees
them
now
and
several
drawers
were
opened
and
the
piano
was
opened
it
had
landscapes
on
the
inside
of
the
lid
and
it
was
so
hoarse
when
the
old
man
played
on
it
and
then
he
hummed
a
song
yes
she
could
sing
that
said
he
and
nodded
to
the
portrait
which
he
had
bought
at
the
broker’s
and
the
old
man’s
eyes
shone
so
bright
i
will
go
to
the
wars
i
will
go
to
the
wars
shouted
the
pewter
soldier
as
loud
as
he
could
and
threw
himself
off
the
drawers
right
down
on
the
floor
what
became
of
him
the
old
man
sought
and
the
little
boy
sought
he
was
away
and
he
stayed
away
i
shall
find
him
said
the
old
man
but
he
never
found
him
the
floor
was
too
open—the
pewter
soldier
had
fallen
through
a
crevice
and
there
he
lay
as
in
an
open
tomb
that
day
passed
and
the
little
boy
went
home
and
that
week
passed
and
several
weeks
too
the
windows
were
quite
frozen
the
little
boy
was
obliged
to
sit
and
breathe
on
them
to
get
a
peep-hole
over
to
the
old
house
and
there
the
snow
had
been
blown
into
all
the
carved
work
and
inscriptions
it
lay
quite
up
over
the
steps
just
as
if
there
was
no
one
at
home—nor
was
there
any
one
at
home
the
old
man
was
dead
in
the
evening
there
was
a
hearse
seen
before
the
door
and
he
was
borne
into
it
in
his
coffin
he
was
now
to
go
out
into
the
country
to
lie
in
his
grave
he
was
driven
out
there
but
no
one
followed
all
his
friends
were
dead
and
the
little
boy
kissed
his
hand
to
the
coffin
as
it
was
driven
away
some
days
afterwards
there
was
an
auction
at
the
old
house
and
the
little
boy
saw
from
his
window
how
they
carried
the
old
knights
and
the
old
ladies
away
the
flower-pots
with
the
long
ears
the
old
chairs
and
the
old
clothes-presses
something
came
here
and
something
came
there
the
portrait
of
her
who
had
been
found
at
the
broker’s
came
to
the
broker’s
again
and
there
it
hung
for
no
one
knew
her
more—no
one
cared
about
the
old
picture
in
the
spring
they
pulled
the
house
down
for
as
people
said
it
was
a
ruin
one
could
see
from
the
street
right
into
the
room
with
the
hog’s-leather
hanging
which
was
slashed
and
torn
and
the
green
grass
and
leaves
about
the
balcony
hung
quite
wild
about
the
falling
beams
and
then
it
was
put
to
rights
that
was
a
relief
said
the
neighboring
houses
a
fine
house
was
built
there
with
large
windows
and
smooth
white
walls
but
before
it
where
the
old
house
had
in
fact
stood
was
a
little
garden
laid
out
and
a
wild
grapevine
ran
up
the
wall
of
the
neighboring
house
before
the
garden
there
was
a
large
iron
railing
with
an
iron
door
it
looked
quite
splendid
and
people
stood
still
and
peeped
in
and
the
sparrows
hung
by
scores
in
the
vine
and
chattered
away
at
each
other
as
well
as
they
could
but
it
was
not
about
the
old
house
for
they
could
not
remember
it
so
many
years
had
passed—so
many
that
the
little
boy
had
grown
up
to
a
whole
man
yes
a
clever
man
and
a
pleasure
to
his
parents
and
he
had
just
been
married
and
together
with
his
little
wife
had
come
to
live
in
the
house
here
where
the
garden
was
and
he
stood
by
her
there
whilst
she
planted
a
field-flower
that
she
found
so
pretty
she
planted
it
with
her
little
hand
and
pressed
the
earth
around
it
with
her
fingers
oh
what
was
that
she
had
stuck
herself
there
sat
something
pointed
straight
out
of
the
soft
mould
it
was—yes
guess
it
was
the
pewter
soldier
he
that
was
lost
up
at
the
old
man’s
and
had
tumbled

the
young
wife
wiped
the
dirt
off
the
soldier
first
with
a
green
leaf
and
then
with
her
fine
handkerchief—it
had
such
a
delightful
smell
that
it
was
to
the
pewter
soldier
just
as
if
he
had
awaked
from
a
trance
let
me
see
him
said
the
young
man
he
laughed
and
then
shook
his
head
nay
it
cannot
be
he
but
he
reminds
me
of
a
story
about
a
pewter
soldier
which
i
had
when
i
was
a
little
boy
and
then
he
told
his
wife
about
the
old
house
and
the
old
man
and
about
the
pewter
soldier
that
he
sent
over
to
him
because
he
was
so
very
very
lonely
and
he
told
it
as
correctly
as
it
had
really
been
so
that
the
tears
came
into
the
eyes
of
his
young
wife
on
account
of
the
old
house
and
the
old
man
it
may
possibly
be
however
that
it
is
the
same
pewter
soldier
said
she
i
will
take
care
of
it
and
remember
all
that
you
have
told
me
but
you
must
show
me
the
old
man’s
grave
but
i
do
not
know
it
said
he
and
no
one
knows
it
all
his
friends
were
dead
no
one
took
care
of
it
and
i
was
then
a
little
boy
how
very
very
lonely
he
must
have
been
said
she
very
very
lonely
said
the
pewter
soldier
but
it
is
delightful
not

be

delightful
shouted
something
close
by
but
no
one
except
the
pewter
soldier
saw
that
it
was
a
piece
of
the
hog’s-leather
hangings
it
had
lost
all
its
gilding
it
looked
like
a

the

really
the
largest
green
leaf
in
this
country
is
a
dock-leaf
if
one
holds
it
before
one
it
is
like
a
whole
apron
and
if
one
holds
it
over
one’s
head
in
rainy
weather
it
is
almost
as
good
as
an
umbrella
for
it
is
so
immensely
large
the
burdock
never
grows
alone
but
where
there
grows
one
there
always
grow
several
it
is
a
great
delight
and
all
this
delightfulness
is
snails’
food
the
great
white
snails
which
persons
of
quality
in
former
times
made
fricassees
of
ate
and
said
hem
hem
how
delicious
for
they
thought
it
tasted
so
delicate—lived
on
dock-leaves
and
therefore
burdock
seeds
were
sown
now
there
was
an
old
manor-house
where
they
no
longer
ate
snails
they
were
quite
extinct
but
the
burdocks
were
not
extinct
they
grew
and
grew
all
over
the
walks
and
all
the
beds
they
could
not
get
the
mastery
over
them—it
was
a
whole
forest
of
burdocks
here
and
there
stood
an
apple
and
a
plum-tree
or
else
one
never
would
have
thought
that
it
was
a
garden
all
was
burdocks
and
there
lived
the
two
last
venerable
old
snails
they
themselves
knew
not
how
old
they
were
but
they
could
remember
very
well
that
there
had
been
many
more
that
they
were
of
a
family
from
foreign
lands
and
that
for
them
and
theirs
the
whole
forest
was
planted
they
had
never
been
outside
it
but
they
knew
that
there
was
still
something
more
in
the
world
which
was
called
the
manor-house
and
that
there
they
were
boiled
and
then
they
became
black
and
were
then
placed
on
a
silver
dish
but
what
happened
further
they
knew
not
or
in
fact
what
it
was
to
be
boiled
and
to
lie
on
a
silver
dish
they
could
not
possibly
imagine
but
it
was
said
to
be
delightful
and
particularly
genteel
neither
the
chafers
the
toads
nor
the
earth-worms
whom
they
asked
about
it
could
give
them
any
information—none
of
them
had
been
boiled
or
laid
on
a
silver
dish
the
old
white
snails
were
the
first
persons
of
distinction
in
the
world
that
they
knew
the
forest
was
planted
for
their
sake
and
the
manor-house
was
there
that
they
might
be
boiled
and
laid
on
a
silver
dish
now
they
lived
a
very
lonely
and
happy
life
and
as
they
had
no
children
themselves
they
had
adopted
a
little
common
snail
which
they
brought
up
as
their
own
but
the
little
one
would
not
grow
for
he
was
of
a
common
family
but
the
old
ones
especially
dame
mother
snail
thought
they
could
observe
how
he
increased
in
size
and
she
begged
father
if
he
could
not
see
it
that
he
would
at
least
feel
the
little
snail’s
shell
and
then
he
felt
it
and
found
the
good
dame
was
right
one
day
there
was
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
hear
how
it
beats
like
a
drum
on
the
dock-leaves
said
father
snail
there
are
also
rain-drops
said
mother
snail
and
now
the
rain
pours
right
down
the
stalk
you
will
see
that
it
will
be
wet
here
i
am
very
happy
to
think
that
we
have
our
good
house
and
the
little
one
has
his
also
there
is
more
done
for
us
than
for
all
other
creatures
sure
enough
but
can
you
not
see
that
we
are
folks
of
quality
in
the
world
we
are
provided
with
a
house
from
our
birth
and
the
burdock
forest
is
planted
for
our
sakes
i
should
like
to
know
how
far
it
extends
and
what
there
is
outside
there
is
nothing
at
all

can

i

the

has
most
likely
fallen
to
ruin
said
father
snail
or
the
burdocks
have
grown
up
over
it
so
that
they
cannot
come
out
there
need
not
however
be
any
haste
about
that
but
you
are
always
in
such
a
tremendous
hurry
and
the
little
one
is
beginning
to
be
the
same
has
he
not
been
creeping
up
that
stalk
these
three
days
it
gives
me
a
headache
when
i
look
up
to
him
you
must
not
scold
him
said
mother
snail
he
creeps
so
carefully
he
will
afford
us
much
pleasure—and
we
have
nothing
but
him
to
live
for
but
have
you
not
thought
of
it
where
shall
we
get
a
wife
for
him
do
you
not
think
that
there
are
some
of
our
species
at
a
great
distance
in
the
interior
of
the
burdock
forest
black
snails
i
dare
say
there
are
enough
of
said
the
old
one
black
snails
without
a
house—but
they
are
so
common
and
so
conceited
but
we
might
give
the
ants
a
commission
to
look
out
for
us
they
run
to
and
fro
as
if
they
had
something
to
do
and
they
certainly
know
of
a
wife
for
our
little
snail
i
know
one
sure
enough—the
most
charming
one
said
one
of
the
ants
but
i
am
afraid
we
shall
hardly
succeed
for
she
is
a
queen
that
is
nothing
said
the
old
folks
has
she
a
house
she
has
a
palace
said
the
ant
the
finest
ant’s
palace
with
seven
hundred
passages
i
thank
you
said
mother
snail
our
son
shall
not
go
into
an
ant-hill
if
you
know
nothing
better
than
that
we
shall
give
the
commission
to
the
white
gnats
they
fly
far
and
wide
in
rain
and
sunshine
they
know
the
whole
forest
here
both
within
and
without
we
have
a
wife
for
him
said
the
gnats
at
a
hundred
human
paces
from
here
there
sits
a
little
snail
in
her
house
on
a
gooseberry
bush
she
is
quite
lonely
and
old
enough
to
be
married
it
is
only
a
hundred
human
paces
well
then
let
her
come
to
him
said
the
old
ones
he
has
a
whole
forest
of
burdocks
she
has
only
a
bush
and
so
they
went
and
fetched
little
miss
snail
it
was
a
whole
week
before
she
arrived
but
therein
was
just
the
very
best
of
it
for
one
could
thus
see
that
she
was
of
the
same
species
and
then
the
marriage
was
celebrated
six
earth-worms
shone
as
well
as
they
could
in
other
respects
the
whole
went
off
very
quietly
for
the
old
folks
could
not
bear
noise
and
merriment
but
old
dame
snail
made
a
brilliant
speech
father
snail
could
not
speak
he
was
too
much
affected
and
so
they
gave
them
as
a
dowry
and
inheritance
the
whole
forest
of
burdocks
and
said—what
they
had
always
said—that
it
was
the
best
in
the
world
and
if
they
lived
honestly
and
decently
and
increased
and
multiplied
they
and
their
children
would
once
in
the
course
of
time
come
to
the
manor-house
be
boiled
black
and
laid
on
silver
dishes
after
this
speech
was
made
the
old
ones
crept
into
their
shells
and
never
more
came
out
they
slept
the
young
couple
governed
in
the
forest
and
had
a
numerous
progeny
but
they
were
never
boiled
and
never
came
on
the
silver
dishes
so
from
this
they
concluded
that
the
manor-house
had
fallen
to
ruins
and
that
all
the
men
in
the
world
were
extinct
and
as
no
one
contradicted
them
so
of
course
it
was
so
and
the
rain
beat
on
the
dock-leaves
to
make
drum-music
for
their
sake
and
the
sun
shone
in
order
to
give
the
burdock
forest
a
color
for
their
sakes
and
they
were
very
happy
and
the
whole
family
was
happy
for
they
indeed
were

the
story
of
a
mother
a
mother
sat
there
with
her
little
child
she
was
so
downcast
so
afraid
that
it
should
die
it
was
so
pale
the
small
eyes
had
closed
themselves
and
it
drew
its
breath
so
softly
now
and
then
with
a
deep
respiration
as
if
it
sighed
and
the
mother
looked
still
more
sorrowfully
on
the
little
creature
then
a
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
and
in
came
a
poor
old
man
wrapped
up
as
in
a
large
horse
cloth
for
it
warms
one
and
he
needed
it
as
it
was
the
cold
winter
season
everything
out-of-doors
was
covered
with
ice
and
snow
and
the
wind
blew
so
that
it
cut
the
face
as
the
old
man
trembled
with
cold
and
the
little
child
slept
a
moment
the
mother
went
and
poured
some
ale
into
a
pot
and
set
it
on
the
stove
that
it
might
be
warm
for
him
the
old
man
sat
and
rocked
the
cradle
and
the
mother
sat
down
on
a
chair
close
by
him
and
looked
at
her
little
sick
child
that
drew
its
breath
so
deep
and
raised
its
little
hand
do
you
not
think
that
i
shall
save
him
said
she
our
lord
will
not
take
him
from
me
and
the
old
man—it
was
death
himself—he
nodded
so
strangely
it
could
just
as
well
signify
yes
as
no
and
the
mother
looked
down
in
her
lap
and
the
tears
ran
down
over
her
cheeks
her
head
became
so
heavy—she
had
not
closed
her
eyes
for
three
days
and
nights
and
now
she
slept
but
only
for
a
minute
when
she
started
up
and
trembled
with
cold
what
is
that
said
she
and
looked
on
all
sides
but
the
old
man
was
gone
and
her
little
child
was
gone—he
had
taken
it
with
him
and
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
burred
and
burred
the
great
leaden
weight
ran
down
to
the
floor
bump
and
then
the
clock
also
stood
still
but
the
poor
mother
ran
out
of
the
house
and
cried
aloud
for
her
child
out
there
in
the
midst
of
the
snow
there
sat
a
woman
in
long
black
clothes
and
she
said
death
has
been
in
thy
chamber
and
i
saw
him
hasten
away
with
thy
little
child
he
goes
faster
than
the
wind
and
he
never
brings
back
what
he
takes
oh
only
tell
me
which
way
he
went
said
the
mother
tell
me
the
way
and
i
shall
find
him
i
know
it
said
the
woman
in
the
black
clothes
but
before
i
tell
it
thou
must
first
sing
for
me
all
the
songs
thou
hast
sung
for
thy
child
i
am
fond
of
them
i
have
heard
them
before
i
am
night
i
saw
thy
tears
whilst
thou
sang’st
them
i
will
sing
them
all
all
said
the
mother
but
do
not
stop
me
now—i
may
overtake
him—i
may
find
my
child
but
night
stood
still
and
mute
then
the
mother
wrung
her
hands
sang
and
wept
and
there
were
many
songs
but
yet
many
more
tears
and
then
night
said
go
to
the
right
into
the
dark
pine
forest
thither
i
saw
death
take
his
way
with
thy
little
child
the
roads
crossed
each
other
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
she
no
longer
knew
whither
she
should
go
then
there
stood
a
thorn-bush
there
was
neither
leaf
nor
flower
on
it
it
was
also
in
the
cold
winter
season
and
ice-flakes
hung
on
the
branches
hast
thou
not
seen
death
go
past
with
my
little
child
said
the
mother
yes
said
the
thorn-bush
but
i
will
not
tell
thee
which
way
he
took
unless
thou
wilt
first
warm
me
up
at
thy
heart
i
am
freezing
to
death
i
shall
become
a
lump
of
ice
and
she
pressed
the
thorn-bush
to
her
breast
so
firmly
that
it
might
be
thoroughly
warmed
and
the
thorns
went
right
into
her
flesh
and
her
blood
flowed
in
large
drops
but
the
thornbush

fresh
green
leaves
and
there
came
flowers
on
it
in
the
cold
winter
night
the
heart
of
the
afflicted
mother
was
so
warm
and
the
thorn-bush
told
her
the
way
she
should
go
she
then
came
to
a
large
lake
where
there
was
neither
ship
nor
boat
the
lake
was
not
frozen
sufficiently
to
bear
her
neither
was
it
open
nor
low
enough
that
she
could
wade
through
it
and
across
it
she
must
go
if
she
would
find
her
child
then
she
lay
down
to
drink
up
the
lake
and
that
was
an
impossibility
for
a
human
being
but
the
afflicted
mother
thought
that
a
miracle
might
happen
nevertheless
oh
what
would
i
not
give
to
come
to
my
child
said
the
weeping
mother
and
she
wept
still
more
and
her
eyes
sunk
down
in
the
depths
of
the
waters
and
became
two
precious
pearls
but
the
water
bore
her
up
as
if
she
sat
in
a
swing
and
she
flew
in
the
rocking
waves
to
the
shore
on
the
opposite
side
where
there
stood
a
mile-broad
strange
house
one
knew
not
if
it
were
a
mountain
with
forests
and
caverns
or
if
it
were
built
up
but
the
poor
mother
could
not
see
it
she
had
wept
her
eyes
out
where
shall
i
find
death
who
took
away
my
little
child
said
she
he
has
not
come
here
yet
said
the
old
grave
woman
who
was
appointed
to
look
after
death’s
great
greenhouse
how
have
you
been
able
to
find
the
way
hither
and
who
has
helped
you
our
lord
has
helped
me
said
she
he
is
merciful
and
you
will
also
be
so
where
shall
i
find
my
little
child
nay
i
know
not
said
the
woman
and
you
cannot
see
many
flowers
and
trees
have
withered
this
night
death
will
soon
come
and
plant
them
over
again
you
certainly
know
that
every
person
has
his
or
her
life’s
tree
or
flower
just
as
everyone
happens
to
be
settled
they
look
like
other
plants
but
they
have
pulsations
of
the
heart
children’s
hearts
can
also
beat
go
after
yours
perhaps
you
may
know
your
child’s
but
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
more
i
have
nothing
to
give
said
the
afflicted
mother
but
i
will
go
to
the
world’s
end
for
you
nay
i
have
nothing
to
do
there
said
the
woman
but
you
can
give
me
your
long
black
hair
you
know
yourself
that
it
is
fine
and
that
i
like
you
shall
have
my
white
hair
instead
and
that’s
always
something
do
you
demand
nothing
else
said
she
that
i
will
gladly
give
you
and
she
gave
her
her
fine
black
hair
and
got
the
old
woman’s
snow-white
hair
instead
so
they
went
into
death’s
great
greenhouse
where
flowers
and
trees
grew
strangely
into
one
another
there
stood
fine
hyacinths
under
glass
bells
and
there
stood
strong-stemmed
peonies
there
grew
water
plants
some
so
fresh
others
half
sick
the
water-snakes
lay
down
on
them
and
black
crabs
pinched
their
stalks
there
stood
beautiful
palm-trees
oaks
and
plantains
there
stood
parsley
and
flowering
thyme
every
tree
and
every
flower
had
its
name
each
of
them
was
a
human
life
the
human
frame
still
lived—one
in
china
and
another
in
greenland—round
about
in
the
world
there
were
large
trees
in
small
pots
so
that
they
stood
so
stunted
in
growth
and
ready
to
burst
the
pots
in
other
places
there
was
a
little
dull
flower
in
rich
mould
with
moss
round
about
it
and
it
was
so
petted
and
nursed
but
the
distressed
mother
bent
down
over
all
the
smallest
plants
and
heard
within
them
how
the
human
heart
beat
and
amongst
millions
she
knew
her
child’s
there
it
is
cried
she
and
stretched
her
hands
out
over
a
little
blue
crocus
that
hung
quite
sickly
on
one
side
don’t
touch
the
flower
said
the
old
woman
but
place
yourself
here
and
when
death
comes—i
expect
him
every
moment—do
not
let
him
pluck
the
flower
up
but
threaten
him
that
you
will
do
the
same
with
the
others
then
he
will
be
afraid
he
is
responsible
for
them

lord

dares
to
pluck
them
up
before
he
gives
leave
all
at
once
an
icy
cold
rushed
through
the
great
hall
and
the
blind
mother
could
feel
that
it
was
death
that
came
how
hast
thou
been
able
to
find
thy
way
hither
he
asked
how
couldst
thou
come
quicker
than
i
i
am
a
mother
said
she
and
death
stretched
out
his
long
hand
towards
the
fine
little
flower
but
she
held
her
hands
fast
around
his
so
tight
and
yet
afraid
that
she
should
touch
one
of
the
leaves
then
death
blew
on
her
hands
and
she
felt
that
it
was
colder
than
the
cold
wind
and
her
hands
fell
down
powerless
thou
canst
not
do
anything
against
me
said
death
but
our
lord
can
said
she
i
only
do
his
bidding
said
death
i
am
his
gardener
i
take
all
his
flowers
and
trees
and
plant
them
out
in
the
great
garden
of
paradise
in
the
unknown
land
but
how
they
grow
there
and
how
it
is
there
i
dare
not
tell
thee
give
me
back
my
child
said
the
mother
and
she
wept
and
prayed
at
once
she
seized
hold
of
two
beautiful
flowers
close
by
with
each
hand
and
cried
out
to
death
i
will
tear
all
thy
flowers
off
for
i
am
in
despair
touch
them
not
said
death
thou
say’st
that
thou
art
so
unhappy
and
now
thou
wilt
make
another
mother
equally
unhappy
another
mother
said
the
poor
woman
and
directly
let
go
her
hold
of
both
the
flowers
there
thou
hast
thine
eyes
said
death
i
fished
them
up
from
the
lake
they
shone
so
bright
i
knew
not
they
were
thine
take
them
again
they
are
now
brighter
than
before
now
look
down
into
the
deep
well
close
by
i
shall
tell
thee
the
names
of
the
two
flowers
thou
wouldst
have
torn
up
and
thou
wilt
see
their
whole
future
life—their
whole
human
existence
and
see
what
thou
wast
about
to
disturb
and
destroy
and
she
looked
down
into
the
well
and
it
was
a
happiness
to
see
how
the
one
became
a
blessing
to
the
world
to
see
how
much
happiness
and
joy
were
felt
everywhere
and
she
saw
the
other’s
life
and
it
was
sorrow
and
distress
horror
and
wretchedness
both
of
them
are
god’s
will
said
death
which
of
them
is
misfortune’s
flower
and
which
is
that
of
happiness
asked
she
that
i
will
not
tell
thee
said
death
but
this
thou
shalt
know
from
me
that
the
one
flower
was
thy
own
child
it
was
thy
child’s
fate
thou
saw’st—thy
own
child’s
future
life
then
the
mother
screamed
with
terror
which
of
them
was
my
child
tell
it
me
save
the
innocent
save
my
child
from
all
that
misery
rather
take
it
away
take
it
into
god’s
kingdom
forget
my
tears
forget
my
prayers
and
all
that
i
have
done
i
do
not
understand
thee
said
death
wilt
thou
have
thy
child
again
or
shall
i
go
with
it
there
where
thou
dost
not
know
then
the
mother
wrung
her
hands
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
to
our
lord
oh
hear
me
not
when
i
pray
against
thy
will
which
is
the
best
hear
me
not
hear
me
not

she
bowed
her
head
down
in
her
lap

death
took
her
child

the
false
collar
there
was
once
a
fine
gentleman
all
of
whose
moveables
were
a
boot-jack
and
a
hair-comb
but
he
had
the
finest
false
collars
in
the
world
and
it
is
about
one
of
these
collars
that
we
are
now
to
hear
a
story
it
was
so
old
that
it
began
to
think
of
marriage
and
it
happened
that
it
came
to
be
washed
in
company
with
a
garter
nay
said
the
collar
i
never
did
see
anything
so
slender
and
so
fine
so
soft
and
so
neat
may
i
not
ask
your
name
that
i
shall
not
tell
you
said
the
garter
where
do
you
live
asked
the
collar
but
the
garter
was
so
bashful
so
modest
and
thought
it
was
a
strange
question
to
answer
you
are
certainly
a
girdle
said
the
collar
that
is
to
say
an
inside
girdle
i
see
well
that
you
are
both
for
use
and
ornament
my
dear
young
lady
i
will
thank
you
not
to
speak
to
me
said
the
garter
i
think
i
have
not
given
the
least
occasion
for
it
yes
when
one
is
as
handsome
as
you
said
the
collar
that
is
occasion
enough
don’t
come
so
near
me
i
beg
of
you
said
the
garter
you
look
so
much
like
those
men-folks
i
am
also
a
fine
gentleman
said
the
collar
i
have
a
bootjack
and
a
hair-comb
but
that
was
not
true
for
it
was
his
master
who
had
them
but
he
boasted
don’t
come
so
near
me
said
the
garter
i
am
not
accustomed
to
it
prude
exclaimed
the
collar
and
then
it
was
taken
out
of
the
washing-tub
it
was
starched
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
in
the
sunshine
and
was
then
laid
on
the
ironing-blanket
then
came
the
warm
box-iron
dear
lady
said
the
collar
dear
widow-lady
i
feel
quite
hot
i
am
quite
changed
i
begin
to
unfold
myself
you
will
burn
a
hole
in
me
oh
i
offer
you
my
hand
rag
said
the
box-iron
and
went
proudly
over
the
collar
for
she
fancied
she
was
a
steam-engine
that
would
go
on
the
railroad
and
draw
the
waggons
rag
said
the
box-iron
the
collar
was
a
little
jagged
at
the
edge
and
so
came
the
long
scissors
to
cut
off
the

i
shall
now
be
obliged
to
ask
the
hair-comb
it
is
surprising
how
well
you
preserve
your
teeth
miss
said
the
collar
have
you
never
thought
of
being
betrothed
yes
of
course
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
the
hair-comb
i
am
betrothed—to
the
boot-jack
betrothed
exclaimed
the
collar
now
there
was
no
other
to
court
and
so
he
despised
it
a
long
time
passed
away
then
the
collar
came
into
the
rag
chest
at
the
paper
mill
there
was
a
large
company
of
rags
the
fine
by
themselves
and
the
coarse
by
themselves
just
as
it
should
be
they
all
had
much
to
say
but
the
collar
the
most
for
he
was
a
real
boaster
i
have
had
such
an
immense
number
of
sweethearts
said
the
collar
i
could
not
be
in
peace
it
is
true
i
was
always
a
fine
starched-up
gentleman
i
had
both
a
boot-jack
and
a
hair-comb
which
i
never
used
you
should
have
seen
me
then
you
should
have
seen
me
when
i
lay
down
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
love—she
was
a
girdle
so
fine
so
soft
and
so
charming
she
threw
herself
into
a
tub
of
water
for
my
sake
there
was
also
a
widow
who
became
glowing
hot
but
i
left
her
standing
till
she
got
black
again
there
was
also
the
first
opera
dancer
she
gave
me
that
cut
which
i
now
go
with
she
was
so
ferocious
my
own
hair-comb
was
in
love
with
me
she
lost
all
her
teeth
from
the
heart-ache
yes
i
have
lived
to
see
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
am
extremely
sorry
for
the
garter—i
mean
the
girdle—that
went
into
the
water-tub
i
have
much
on
my
conscience
i
want
to
become
white
paper
and
it
became
so
all
the
rags
were
turned
into
white
paper
but
the
collar
came
to
be
just
this
very
piece
of
white
paper
we
here
see
and
on
which
the
story
is
printed
and
that
was
because
it
boasted
so
terribly
afterwards
of
what
had
never
happened
to
it
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
beware
that
we
may
not
act
in
a
similar
manner
for
we
can
never
know
if
we
may
not
in
the
course
of
time
also
come
into
the
rag
chest
and
be
made
into
white
paper
and
then
have
our
whole

history
printed
on
it
even
the

secret

about

the
shadow
it
is
in
the
hot
lands
that
the
sun
burns
sure
enough
there
the
people
become
quite
a
mahogany
brown
ay
and
in
the
hottest
lands
they
are
burnt
to
negroes
but
now
it
was
only
to
the
hot
lands
that
a
learned
man
had
come
from
the
cold
there
he
thought
that
he
could
run
about
just
as
when
at
home
but
he
soon
found
out
his
mistake
he
and
all
sensible
folks
were
obliged
to
stay
within
doors—the
window-shutters
and
doors
were
closed
the
whole
day
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
house
slept
or
there
was
no
one
at
home
the
narrow
street
with
the
high
houses
was
built
so
that
the
sunshine
must
fall
there
from
morning
till
evening—it
was
really
not
to
be
borne
the
learned
man
from
the
cold
lands—he
was
a
young
man
and
seemed
to
be
a
clever
man—sat
in
a
glowing
oven
it
took
effect
on
him
he
became
quite
meagre—even
his
shadow
shrunk
in
for
the
sun
had
also
an
effect
on
it
it
was
first
towards
evening
when
the
sun
was
down
that
they
began
to
freshen
up
again
in
the
warm
lands
every
window
has
a
balcony
and
the
people
came
out
on
all
the
balconies
in
the
street—for
one
must
have
air
even
if
one
be
accustomed
to
be
mahogany
it
was
lively
both
up
and
down
the
street
tailors
and
shoemakers
and
all
the
folks
moved
out
into
the
street—chairs
and
tables
were
brought
forth—and
candles
burnt—yes
above
a
thousand
lights
were
burning—and
the
one
talked
and
the
other
sung
and
people
walked
and
church-bells
rang
and
asses
went
along
with
a
dingle-dingle-dong
for
they
too
had
bells
on
the
street
boys
were
screaming
and
hooting
and
shouting
and
shooting
with
devils
and
detonating
balls—and
there
came
corpse
bearers
and
hood
wearers—for
there
were
funerals
with
psalm
and
hymn—and
then
the
din
of
carriages
driving
and
company
arriving
yes
it
was
in
truth
lively
enough
down
in
the
street
only
in
that
single
house
which
stood
opposite
that
in
which
the
learned
foreigner
lived
it
was
quite
still
and
yet
some
one
lived
there
for
there
stood
flowers
in
the
balcony—they
grew
so
well
in
the
sun’s
heat
and
that
they
could
not
do
unless
they
were
watered—and
some
one
must
water
them—there
must
be
somebody
there
the
door
opposite
was
also
opened
late
in
the
evening
but
it
was
dark
within
at
least
in
the
front
room
further
in
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
music
the
learned
foreigner
thought
it
quite
marvellous
but
now—it
might
be
that
he
only
imagined
it—for
he
found
everything
marvellous
out
there
in
the
warm
lands
if
there
had
only
been
no
sun
the
stranger’s
landlord
said
that
he
didn’t
know
who
had
taken
the
house
opposite
one
saw
no
person
about
and
as
to
the
music
it
appeared
to
him
to
be
extremely
tiresome
it
is
as
if
some
one
sat
there
and
practised
a
piece
that
he
could
not
master—always
the
same
piece
‘i
shall
master
it!’
says
he
but
yet
he
cannot
master
it
however
long
he
plays
the
word
mahogany
can
be
understood
in
danish
as
having
two
meanings
in
general
it
means
the
reddish-brown
wood
itself
but
in
jest
it
signifies
excessively
fine
which
arose
from
an
anecdote
of
nyboder
in
copenhagen
the
seamen’s
quarter
a
sailor’s
wife
who
was
always
proud
and
fine
in
her
way
came
to
her
neighbor
and
complained
that
she
had
got
a
splinter
in
her
finger
what
of
asked
the
neighbor’s
wife
it
is
a
mahogany
splinter
said
the
other
mahogany
it
cannot
be
less
with
you
exclaimed
the
woman—and
thence
the
proverb
it
is
so
mahogany!”—(that
is
so
excessively
fine)—is
derived
one
night
the
stranger
awoke—he
slept
with
the
doors
of
the
balcony
open—the
curtain
before
it
was
raised
by
the
wind
and
he
thought
that
a
strange
lustre
came
from
the
opposite
neighbor’s
house
all
the
flowers
shone
like
flames
in
the
most
beautiful
colors
and
in
the
midst
of
the
flowers
stood
a
slender
graceful
maiden—it
was
as
if
she
also
shone
the
light
really
hurt
his
eyes
he

opened
them
quite
wide—yes
he
was
quite
awake
with
one
spring
he
was
on
the
floor
he
crept
gently
behind
the
curtain
but
the
maiden
was
gone
the
flowers
shone
no
longer
but
there
they
stood
fresh
and
blooming
as
ever
the
door
was
ajar
and
far
within
the
music
sounded
so
soft
and
delightful
one
could
really
melt
away
in
sweet
thoughts
from
it
yet
it
was
like
a
piece
of
enchantment
and
who
lived
there
where
was
the
actual
entrance
the
whole
of
the
ground-floor
was
a
row
of
shops
and
there
people
could
not
always
be
running
through
one
evening
the
stranger
sat
out
on
the
balcony
the
light
burnt
in
the
room
behind
him
and
thus
it
was
quite
natural
that
his
shadow
should
fall
on
his
opposite
neighbor’s
wall
yes
there
it
sat
directly
opposite
between
the
flowers
on
the
balcony
and
when
the
stranger
moved
the
shadow
also
moved
for
that
it
always
does
i
think
my
shadow
is
the
only
living
thing
one
sees
over
there
said
the
learned
man
see
how
nicely
it
sits
between
the
flowers
the
door
stands
half-open
now
the
shadow
should
be
cunning
and
go
into
the
room
look
about
and
then
come
and
tell
me
what
it
had
seen
come
now
be
useful
and
do
me
a
service
said
he
in
jest
have
the
kindness
to
step
in
now
art
thou
going
and
then
he
nodded
to
the
shadow
and
the
shadow
nodded
again
well
then
go
but
don’t
stay
away
the
stranger
rose
and
his
shadow
on
the
opposite
neighbor’s
balcony
rose
also
the
stranger
turned
round
and
the
shadow
also
turned
round
yes
if
anyone
had
paid
particular
attention
to
it
they
would
have
seen
quite
distinctly
that
the
shadow
went
in
through
the
half-open
balcony-door
of
their
opposite
neighbor
just
as
the
stranger
went
into
his
own
room
and
let
the
long
curtain
fall
down
after
him
next
morning
the
learned
man
went
out
to
drink
coffee
and
read
the
newspapers
what
is
that
said
he
as
he
came
out
into
the
sunshine
i
have
no
shadow
so
then
it
has
actually
gone
last
night
and
not
come
again
it
is
really
tiresome
this
annoyed
him
not
so
much
because
the
shadow
was
gone
but
because
he
knew
there
was
a
story
about
a
man
without
a
shadow
it
was
known
to
everybody
at
home
in
the
cold
lands
and
if
the
learned
man
now
came
there
and
told
his
story
they
would
say
that
he
was
imitating
it
and
that
he
had
no
need
to
do
he
would
therefore
not
talk
about
it
at
all
and
that
was
wisely
thought
peter
schlemihl
the
shadowless
man
in
the
evening
he
went
out
again
on
the
balcony
he
had
placed
the
light
directly
behind
him
for
he
knew
that
the
shadow
would
always
have
its
master
for
a
screen
but
he
could
not
entice
it
he
made
himself
little
he
made
himself
great
but
no
shadow
came
again
he
said
hem
hem
but
it
was
of
no
use
it
was
vexatious
but
in
the
warm
lands
everything
grows
so
quickly
and
after
the
lapse
of
eight
days
he
observed
to
his
great
joy
that
a
new
shadow
came
in
the
sunshine
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
he
had
a
very
fair
shadow
which
when
he
set
out
for
his
home
in
the
northern
lands
grew
more
and
more
in
the
journey
so
that
at
last
it
was
so
long
and
so
large
that
it
was
more
than
sufficient
the
learned
man
then
came
home
and
he
wrote
books
about
what
was
true
in
the
world
and
about
what
was
good
and
what
was
beautiful
and
there
passed
days
and
years—yes
many
years
passed
away
one
evening
as
he
was
sitting
in
his
room
there
was
a
gentle
knocking
at
the
door
come
in
said
he
but
no
one
came
in
so
he
opened
the
door
and
there
stood
before
him

extremely
lean
man
that
he
felt
quite
strange
as
to
the
rest
the
man
was
very
finely
dressed—he
must
be
a
gentleman
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
asked
the
learned
man
yes
i
thought
as
much
said
the
fine
man
i
thought
you
would
not
know
me
i
have
got
so
much
body
i
have
even
got
flesh
and
clothes
you
certainly
never
thought
of
seeing
me
so
well
off
do
you
not
know
your
old
shadow
you
certainly
thought
i
should
never
more
return
things
have
gone
on
well
with
me
since
i
was
last
with
you
i
have
in
all
respects
become
very
well
off
shall
i
purchase
my
freedom
from
service
if
so
i
can
do
it
and
then
he
rattled
a
whole
bunch
of
valuable
seals
that
hung
to
his
watch
and
he
stuck
his
hand
in
the
thick
gold
chain
he
wore
around
his
neck
nay
how
all
his
fingers
glittered
with
diamond
rings
and
then
all
were
pure
gems
nay
i
cannot
recover
from
my
surprise
said
the
learned
man
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
something
common
is
it
not
said
the
shadow
but
you
yourself
do
not
belong
to
the
common
order
and
i
as
you
know
well
have
from
a
child
followed
in
your
footsteps
as
soon
as
you
found
i
was
capable
to
go
out
alone
in
the
world
i
went
my
own
way
i
am
in
the
most
brilliant
circumstances
but
there
came
a
sort
of
desire
over
me
to
see
you
once
more
before
you
die
you
will
die
i
suppose
i
also
wished
to
see
this
land
again—for
you
know
we
always
love
our
native
land
i
know
you
have
got
another
shadow
again
have
i
anything
to
pay
to
it
or
you
if
so
you
will
oblige
me
by
saying
what
it
is
nay
is
it
really
thou
said
the
learned
man
it
is
most
remarkable
i
never
imagined
that
one’s
old
shadow
could
come
again
as
a
man
tell
me
what
i
have
to
pay
said
the
shadow
for
i
don’t
like
to
be
in
any
sort
of
debt
how
canst
thou
talk
so
said
the
learned
man
what
debt
is
there
to
talk
about
make
thyself
as
free
as
anyone
else
i
am
extremely
glad
to
hear
of
thy
good
fortune
sit
down
old
friend
and
tell
me
a
little
how
it
has
gone
with
thee
and
what
thou
hast
seen
at
our
opposite
neighbor’s
there—in
the
warm
lands
yes
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
said
the
shadow
and
sat
down
but
then
you
must
also
promise
me
that
wherever
you
may
meet
me
you
will
never
say
to
anyone
here
in
the
town
that
i
have
been
your
shadow
i
intend
to
get
betrothed
for
i
can
provide
for
more
than
one
family
be
quite
at
thy
ease
about
that
said
the
learned
man
i
shall
not
say
to
anyone
who
thou
actually
art
here
is
my
hand—i
promise
it
and
a
man’s
bond
is
his
word
a
word
is
a
shadow
said
the
shadow
and
as
such
it
must
speak
it
was
really
quite
astonishing
how
much
of
a
man
it
was
it
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
of
the
very
finest
cloth
it
had
patent
leather
boots
and
a
hat
that
could
be
folded
together
so
that
it
was
bare
crown
and
brim
not
to
speak
of
what
we
already
know
it
had—seals
gold
neck-chain
and
diamond
rings
yes
the
shadow
was
well-dressed
and
it
was
just
that
which
made
it
quite
a
man
now
i
shall
tell
you
my
adventures
said
the
shadow
and
then
he
sat
with
the
polished
boots
as
heavily
as
he
could
on
the
arm
of
the
learned
man’s
new
shadow
which
lay
like
a
poodle-dog
at
his
feet
now
this
was
perhaps
from
arrogance
and
the
shadow
on
the
ground
kept
itself
so
still
and
quiet
that
it
might
hear
all
that
passed
it
wished
to
know
how
it
could
get
free
and
work
its
way
up
so
as
to
become
its
own
master
do
you
know
who
lived
in
our
opposite
neighbor’s
house
said
the
shadow
it
was
the
most
charming
of
all
beings
it
was
poesy
i
was
there
for
three
weeks
and
that
has
as
much

and
it
is
right
i
have
seen
everything
and
i
know
everything
poesy
cried
the
learned
man
yes
yes
she
often
dwells
a
recluse
in
large
cities
poesy
yes
i
have
seen
her—a
single
short
moment
but
sleep
came
into
my
eyes
she
stood
on
the
balcony
and
shone
as
the
aurora
borealis
shines
go
on
go
on—thou
wert
on
the
balcony
and
went
through
the
doorway
and
then
then
i
was
in
the
antechamber
said
the
shadow
you
always
sat
and
looked
over
to
the
antechamber
there
was
no
light
there
was
a
sort
of
twilight
but
the
one
door
stood
open
directly
opposite
the
other
through
a
long
row
of
rooms
and
saloons
and
there
it
was
lighted
up
i
should
have
been
completely
killed
if
i
had
gone
over
to
the
maiden
but
i
was
circumspect
i
took
time
to
think
and
that
one
must
always
do
and
what
didst
thou
then
see
asked
the
learned
man
i
saw
everything
and
i
shall
tell
all
to
you
but—it
is
no
pride
on
my
part—as
a
free
man
and
with
the
knowledge
i
have
not
to
speak
of
my
position
in
life
my
excellent
circumstances—i
certainly
wish
that
you
would
say
you
to
me
it
is
the
custom
in
denmark
for
intimate
acquaintances
to
use
the
second
person
singular
du
thou
when
speaking
to
each
other
when
a
friendship
is
formed
between
men
they
generally
affirm
it
when
occasion
offers
either
in
public
or
private
by
drinking
to
each
other
and
exclaiming
thy
health
at
the
same
time
striking
their
glasses
together
this
is
called
drinking
duus
they
are
then
duus
brodre
thou
brothers
and
ever
afterwards
use
the
pronoun
thou
to
each
other
it
being
regarded
as
more
familiar
than
de
you
father
and
mother
sister
and
brother
say
thou
to
one
another—without
regard
to
age
or
rank
master
and
mistress
say
thou
to
their
servants
the
superior
to
the
inferior
but
servants
and
inferiors
do
not
use
the
same
term
to
their
masters
or
superiors—nor
is
it
ever
used
when
speaking
to
a
stranger
or
anyone
with
whom
they
are
but
slightly
acquainted—they
then
say
as
in
english—you
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
learned
man
it
is
an
old
habit
with
me
you
are
perfectly
right
and
i
shall
remember
it
but
now
you
must
tell
me
all
you
saw
everything
said
the
shadow
for
i
saw
everything
and
i
know
everything
how
did
it
look
in
the
furthest
saloon
asked
the
learned
man
was
it
there
as
in
the
fresh
woods
was
it
there
as
in
a
holy
church
were
the
saloons
like
the
starlit
firmament
when
we
stand
on
the
high
mountains
everything
was
there
said
the
shadow
i
did
not
go
quite
in
i
remained
in
the
foremost
room
in
the
twilight
but
i
stood
there
quite
well
i
saw
everything
and
i
know
everything
i
have
been
in
the
antechamber
at
the
court
of
poesy
but
what
did
you
see
did
all
the
gods
of
the
olden
times
pass
through
the
large
saloons
did
the
old
heroes
combat
there
did
sweet
children
play
there
and
relate
their
dreams
i
tell
you
i
was
there
and
you
can
conceive
that
i
saw
everything
there
was
to
be
seen
had
you
come
over
there
you
would
not
have
been
a
man
but
i
became
so
and
besides
i
learned
to
know
my
inward
nature
my
innate
qualities
the
relationship
i
had
with
poesy
at
the
time
i
was
with
you
i
thought
not
of
that
but
always—you
know
it
well—when
the
sun
rose
and
when
the
sun
went
down
i
became
so
strangely
great
in
the
moonlight
i
was
very
near
being
more
distinct
than
yourself
at
that
time
i
did
not
understand
my
nature
it
was
revealed
to
me
in
the
antechamber
i
became
a
man
i
came
out
matured
but
you
were
no
longer
in
the
warm
lands
as
a
man
i
was
ashamed
to
go
as
i
did
i
was
in
want
of
boots
of
clothes
of
the
whole
human
varnish

man
perceptible
i
took
my
way—i
tell
it
to
you
but
you
will
not
put
it
in
any
book—i
took
my
way
to
the
cake
woman—i
hid
myself
behind
her
the
woman
didn’t
think
how
much
she
concealed
i
went
out
first
in
the
evening
i
ran
about
the
streets
in
the
moonlight
i
made
myself
long
up
the
walls—it
tickles
the
back
so
delightfully
i
ran
up
and
ran
down
peeped
into
the
highest
windows
into
the
saloons
and
on
the
roofs
i
peeped
in
where
no
one
could
peep
and
i
saw
what
no
one
else
saw
what
no
one
else
should
see
this
is
in
fact
a
base
world
i
would
not
be
a
man
if
it
were
not
now
once
accepted
and
regarded
as
something
to
be
so
i
saw
the
most
unimaginable
things
with
the
women
with
the
men
with
parents
and
with
the
sweet
matchless
children
i
saw
said
the
shadow
what
no
human
being
must
know
but
what
they
would
all
so
willingly
know—what
is
bad
in
their
neighbor
had
i
written
a
newspaper
it
would
have
been
read
but
i
wrote
direct
to
the
persons
themselves
and
there
was
consternation
in
all
the
towns
where
i
came
they
were
so
afraid
of
me
and
yet
they
were
so
excessively
fond
of
me
the
professors
made
a
professor
of
me
the
tailors
gave
me
new
clothes—i
am
well
furnished
the
master
of
the
mint
struck
new
coin
for
me
and
the
women
said
i
was
so
handsome
and
so
i
became
the
man
i
am
and
i
now
bid
you
farewell
here
is
my
card—i
live
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
and
am
always
at
home
in
rainy
weather
and
so
away
went
the
shadow
that
was
most
extraordinary
said
the
learned
man
years
and
days
passed
away
then
the
shadow
came
again
how
goes
it
said
the
shadow
alas
said
the
learned
man
i
write
about
the
true
and
the
good
and
the
beautiful
but
no
one
cares
to
hear
such
things
i
am
quite
desperate
for
i
take
it
so
much
to
heart
but
i
don’t
said
the
shadow
i
become
fat
and
it
is
that
one
wants
to
become
you
do
not
understand
the
world
you
will
become
ill
by
it
you
must
travel
i
shall
make
a
tour
this
summer
will
you
go
with
me
i
should
like
to
have
a
travelling
companion
will
you
go
with
me
as
shadow
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
have
you
with
me
i
shall
pay
the
travelling
expenses
nay
this
is
too
much
said
the
learned
man
it
is
just
as
one
takes
it
said
the
shadow
it
will
do
you
much
good
to
travel
will
you
be
my
shadow
you
shall
have
everything
free
on
the
journey
nay
that
is
too
bad
said
the
learned
man
but
it
is
just
so
with
the
world
said
the
shadow
and
so
it
will
be
and
away
it
went
again
the
learned
man
was
not
at
all
in
the
most
enviable
state
grief
and
torment
followed
him
and
what
he
said
about
the
true
and
the
good
and
the
beautiful
was
to
most
persons
like
roses
for
a
cow
he
was
quite
ill
at
last
you
really
look
like
a
shadow
said
his
friends
to
him
and
the
learned
man
trembled
for
he
thought
of
it
you
must
go
to
a
watering-place
said
the
shadow
who
came
and
visited
him
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
i
will
take
you
with
me
for
old
acquaintance’
sake
i
will
pay
the
travelling
expenses
and
you
write
the
descriptions—and
if
they
are
a
little
amusing
for
me
on
the
way
i
will
go
to
a
watering-place—my
beard
does
not
grow
out
as
it
ought—that
is
also
a
sickness—and
one
must
have
a
beard
now
you
be
wise
and
accept
the
offer
we
shall
travel
as
comrades
and
so
they
travelled
the
shadow
was
master
and
the
master
was
the
shadow
they
drove
with
each
other
they
rode
and
walked
together
side
by
side
before
and
behind
just
as
the
sun
was
the
shadow
always
took
care
to
keep
itself
in
the
master’s
place
now
the
learned
man
didn’t
think
much
about
that
he
was
a
very
kind-hearted
man
and
particularly
mild
and
friendly
and
so
he
said
one
day
to
the
shadow
as
we
have
now
become
companions
and
in
this
way
have
grown
up
together
from
childhood
shall
we
not
drink

together

you
are
right
said
the
shadow
who
was
now
the
proper
master
it
is
said
in
a
very
straight
forward
and
well-meant
manner
you
as
a
learned
man
certainly
know
how
strange
nature
is
some
persons
cannot
bear
to
touch
grey
paper
or
they
become
ill
others
shiver
in
every
limb
if
one
rub
a
pane
of
glass
with
a
nail
i
have
just
such
a
feeling
on
hearing
you
say
thou
to
me
i
feel
myself
as
if
pressed
to
the
earth
in
my
first
situation
with
you
you
see
that
it
is
a
feeling
that
it
is
not
pride
i
cannot
allow
you
to
say
thou
to
me
but
i
will
willingly
say
thou
to
you
so
it
is
half
done
so
the
shadow
said
thou
to
its
former
master
this
is
rather
too
bad
thought
he
that
i
must
say
you
and
he
say
thou
but
he
was
now
obliged
to
put
up
with
it
so
they
came
to
a
watering-place
where
there
were
many
strangers
and
amongst
them
was
a
princess
who
was
troubled
with
seeing
too
well
and
that
was
so
alarming
she
directly
observed
that
the
stranger
who
had
just
come
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
person
to
all
the
others
he
has
come
here
in
order
to
get
his
beard
to
grow
they
say
but
i
see
the
real
cause
he
cannot
cast
a
shadow
she
had
become
inquisitive
and
so
she
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
the
strange
gentleman
on
their
promenades
as
the
daughter
of
a
king
she
needed
not
to
stand
upon
trifles
so
she
said
your
complaint
is
that
you
cannot
cast
a
shadow
your
royal
highness
must
be
improving
considerably
said
the
shadow
i
know
your
complaint
is
that
you
see
too
clearly
but
it
has
decreased
you
are
cured
i
just
happen
to
have
a
very
unusual
shadow
do
you
not
see
that
person
who
always
goes
with
me
other
persons
have
a
common
shadow
but
i
do
not
like
what
is
common
to
all
we
give
our
servants
finer
cloth
for
their
livery
than
we
ourselves
use
and
so
i
had
my
shadow
trimmed
up
into
a
man
yes
you
see
i
have
even
given
him
a
shadow
it
is
somewhat
expensive
but
i
like
to
have
something
for
myself
what
thought
the
princess
should
i
really
be
cured
these
baths
are
the
first
in
the
world
in
our
time
water
has
wonderful
powers
but
i
shall
not
leave
the
place
for
it
now
begins
to
be
amusing
here
i
am
extremely
fond
of
that
stranger
would
that
his
beard
should
not
grow
for
in
that
case
he
will
leave
us
in
the
evening
the
princess
and
the
shadow
danced
together
in
the
large
ball-room
she
was
light
but
he
was
still
lighter
she
had
never
had
such
a
partner
in
the
dance
she
told
him
from
what
land
she
came
and
he
knew
that
land
he
had
been
there
but
then
she
was
not
at
home
he
had
peeped
in
at
the
window
above
and
below—he
had
seen
both
the
one
and
the
other
and
so
he
could
answer
the
princess
and
make
insinuations
so
that
she
was
quite
astonished
he
must
be
the
wisest
man
in
the
whole
world
she
felt
such
respect
for
what
he
knew
so
that
when
they
again
danced
together
she
fell
in
love
with
him
and
that
the
shadow
could
remark
for
she
almost
pierced
him
through
with
her
eyes
so
they
danced
once
more
together
and
she
was
about
to
declare
herself
but
she
was
discreet
she
thought
of
her
country
and
kingdom
and
of
the
many
persons
she
would
have
to
reign
over
he
is
a
wise
man
said
she
to
herself—“it
is
well
and
he
dances
delightfully—that
is
also
good
but
has
he
solid
knowledge
that
is
just
as
important
he
must
be
examined
so
she
began
by
degrees
to
question
him
about
the
most
difficult
things
she
could
think
of
and
which
she
herself
could
not
have
answered
so
that
the
shadow
made
a
strange
face
you
cannot
answer
these
questions
said
the
princess

they
belong
to
my
childhood’s
learning
said
the
shadow
i
really
believe
my
shadow
by
the
door
there
can
answer
them
your
shadow
said
the
princess
that
would
indeed
be
marvellous
i
will
not
say
for
a
certainty
that
he
can
said
the
shadow
but
i
think
so
he
has
now
followed
me
for
so
many
years
and
listened
to
my
conversation—i
should
think
it
possible
but
your
royal
highness
will
permit
me
to
observe
that
he
is
so
proud
of
passing
himself
off
for
a
man
that
when
he
is
to
be
in
a
proper
humor—and
he
must
be
so
to
answer
well—he
must
be
treated
quite
like
a
man
oh
i
like
that
said
the
princess
so
she
went
to
the
learned
man
by
the
door
and
she
spoke
to
him
about
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
about
persons
out
of
and
in
the
world
and
he
answered
with
wisdom
and
prudence
what
a
man
that
must
be
who
has
so
wise
a
shadow
thought
she
it
will
be
a
real
blessing
to
my
people
and
kingdom
if
i
choose
him
for
my
consort—i
will
do
it
they
were
soon
agreed
both
the
princess
and
the
shadow
but
no
one
was
to
know
about
it
before
she
arrived
in
her
own
kingdom
no
one—not
even
my
shadow
said
the
shadow
and
he
had
his
own
thoughts
about
it
now
they
were
in
the
country
where
the
princess
reigned
when
she
was
at
home
listen
my
good
friend
said
the
shadow
to
the
learned
man
i
have
now
become
as
happy
and
mighty
as
anyone
can
be
i
will
therefore
do
something
particular
for
thee
thou
shalt
always
live
with
me
in
the
palace
drive
with
me
in
my
royal
carriage
and
have
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
but
then
thou
must
submit
to
be
called
shadow
by
all
and
everyone
thou
must
not
say
that
thou
hast
ever
been
a
man
and
once
a
year
when
i
sit
on
the
balcony
in
the
sunshine
thou
must
lie
at
my
feet
as
a
shadow
shall
do
i
must
tell
thee
i
am
going
to
marry
the
king’s
daughter
and
the
nuptials
are
to
take
place
this
evening
nay
this
is
going
too
far
said
the
learned
man
i
will
not
have
it
i
will
not
do
it
it
is
to
deceive
the
whole
country
and
the
princess
too
i
will
tell
everything
that
i
am
a
man
and
that
thou
art
a
shadow—thou
art
only
dressed
up
there
is
no
one
who
will
believe
it
said
the
shadow
be
reasonable
or
i
will
call
the
guard
i
will
go
directly
to
the
princess
said
the
learned
man
but
i
will
go
first
said
the
shadow
and
thou
wilt
go
to

the
little
match
girl
most
terribly
cold
it
was
it
snowed
and
was
nearly
quite
dark
and
evening—the
last
evening
of
the
year
in
this
cold
and
darkness
there
went
along
the
street
a
poor
little
girl
bareheaded
and
with
naked
feet
when
she
left
home
she
had
slippers
on
it
is
true
but
what
was
the
good
of
that
they
were
very
large
slippers
which
her
mother
had
hitherto
worn
so
large
were
they
and
the
poor
little
thing
lost
them
as
she
scuffled
away
across
the
street
because
of
two
carriages
that
rolled
by
dreadfully
fast
one
slipper
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
other
had
been
laid
hold
of
by
an
urchin
and
off
he
ran
with
it
he
thought
it
would
do
capitally
for
a
cradle
when
he
some
day
or
other
should
have
children
himself
so
the
little
maiden
walked
on
with
her
tiny
naked
feet
that
were
quite
red
and
blue
from
cold
she
carried
a
quantity
of
matches
in
an
old
apron
and
she
held
a
bundle
of
them
in
her
hand
nobody
had
bought
anything
of
her
the
whole
livelong
day
no
one
had
given
her
a
single
farthing
she
crept
along
trembling
with
cold
and
hunger—a
very
picture
of
sorrow
the
poor
little
thing
the
flakes
of
snow
covered
her
long
fair
hair
which
fell
in
beautiful
curls
around
her
neck
but
of
that
of
course
she
never
once
now
thought
from
all
the
windows
the
candles
were
gleaming
and
it
smelt
so
deliciously
of
roast
goose
for
you
know
it
was
new
year’s
eve
yes
of
that
she
thought
in
a
corner
formed
by
two
houses
of
which
one
advanced
more
than
the
other
she
seated
herself
down
and
cowered
together
her
little
feet
she
had
drawn
close
up
to
her
but
she
grew
colder
and
colder
and
to
go
home
she
did
not
venture
for
she
had
not
sold
any
matches
and
could
not
bring
a
farthing
of
money
from
her
father
she
would
certainly
get
blows
and
at
home
it
was
cold
too
for
above
her
she
had
only
the
roof
through
which
the
wind
whistled
even
though
the
largest
cracks
were
stopped
up
with
straw
and
rags
her
little
hands
were
almost
numbed
with
cold
oh
a
match
might
afford
her
a
world
of
comfort
if
she
only
dared
take
a
single
one
out
of
the
bundle
draw
it
against
the
wall
and
warm
her
fingers
by
it
she
drew
one
out
rischt
how
it
blazed
how
it
burnt
it
was
a
warm
bright
flame
like
a
candle
as
she
held
her
hands
over
it
it
was
a
wonderful
light
it
seemed
really
to
the
little
maiden
as
though
she
were
sitting
before
a
large
iron
stove
with
burnished
brass
feet
and
a
brass
ornament
at
top
the
fire
burned
with
such
blessed
influence
it
warmed
so
delightfully
the
little
girl
had
already
stretched
out
her
feet
to
warm
them
too
but—the
small
flame
went
out
the
stove
vanished
she
had
only
the
remains
of
the
burnt-out
match
in
her
hand
she
rubbed
another
against
the
wall
it
burned
brightly
and
where
the
light
fell
on
the
wall
there
the
wall
became
transparent
like
a
veil
so
that
she
could
see
into
the
room
on
the
table
was
spread
a
snow-white
tablecloth
upon
it
was
a
splendid
porcelain
service
and
the
roast
goose
was
steaming
famously
with
its
stuffing
of
apple
and
dried
plums
and
what
was
still
more
capital
to
behold
was
the
goose
hopped
down
from
the
dish
reeled
about
on
the
floor
with
knife
and
fork
in
its
breast
till
it
came
up
to
the
poor
little
girl
when—the
match
went
out
and
nothing
but
the
thick
cold
damp
wall
was
left
behind
she
lighted
another
match
now
there
she
was
sitting
under
the
most
magnificent
christmas
tree
it
was
still
larger
and
more
decorated
than
the
one
which
she
had
seen
through
the
glass
door
in
the
rich
merchant’s
house
thousands
of
lights
were
burning
on
the
green
branches
and
gaily-colored
pictures
such
as
she
had
seen
in
the
shop-windows
looked
down
upon
her
the
little
maiden
stretched
out
her
hands
towards
them
when—the
match
went
out
the
lights
of
the
christmas
tree
rose
higher
and
higher

them
now
as
stars
in
heaven
one
fell
down
and
formed
a
long
trail
of
fire
someone
is
just
dead
said
the
little
girl
for
her
old
grandmother
the
only
person
who
had
loved
her
and
who
was
now
no
more
had
told
her
that
when
a
star
falls
a
soul
ascends
to
god
she
drew
another
match
against
the
wall
it
was
again
light
and
in
the
lustre
there
stood
the
old
grandmother
so
bright
and
radiant
so
mild
and
with
such
an
expression
of
love
grandmother
cried
the
little
one
oh
take
me
with
you
you
go
away
when
the
match
burns
out
you
vanish
like
the
warm
stove
like
the
delicious
roast
goose
and
like
the
magnificent
christmas
tree
and
she
rubbed
the
whole
bundle
of
matches
quickly
against
the
wall
for
she
wanted
to
be
quite
sure
of
keeping
her
grandmother
near
her
and
the
matches
gave
such
a
brilliant
light
that
it
was
brighter
than
at
noon-day
never
formerly
had
the
grandmother
been
so
beautiful
and
so
tall
she
took
the
little
maiden
on
her
arm
and
both
flew
in
brightness
and
in
joy
so
high
so
very
high
and
then
above
was
neither
cold
nor
hunger
nor
anxiety—they
were
with
god
but
in
the
corner
at
the
cold
hour
of
dawn
sat
the
poor
girl
with
rosy
cheeks
and
with
a
smiling
mouth
leaning
against
the
wall—frozen
to
death
on
the
last
evening
of
the
old
year
stiff
and
stark
sat
the
child
there
with
her
matches
of
which
one
bundle
had
been
burnt
she
wanted
to
warm
herself
people
said
no
one
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
beautiful
things
she
had
seen
no
one
even
dreamed
of
the
splendor
in
which
with
her
grandmother
she
had
entered

the
dream
of
little
tuk
ah
yes
that
was
little
tuk
in
reality
his
name
was
not
tuk
but
that
was
what
he
called
himself
before
he
could
speak
plain
he
meant
it
for
charles
and
it
is
all
well
enough
if
one
does
but
know
it
he
had
now
to
take
care
of
his
little
sister
augusta
who
was
much
younger
than
himself
and
he
was
besides
to
learn
his
lesson
at
the
same
time
but
these
two
things
would
not
do
together
at
all
there
sat
the
poor
little
fellow
with
his
sister
on
his
lap
and
he
sang
to
her
all
the
songs
he
knew
and
he
glanced
the
while
from
time
to
time
into
the
geography-book
that
lay
open
before
him
by
the
next
morning
he
was
to
have
learnt
all
the
towns
in
zealand
by
heart
and
to
know
about
them
all
that
is
possible
to
be
known
his
mother
now
came
home
for
she
had
been
out
and
took
little
augusta
on
her
arm
tuk
ran
quickly
to
the
window
and
read
so
eagerly
that
he
pretty
nearly
read
his
eyes
out
for
it
got
darker
and
darker
but
his
mother
had
no
money
to
buy
a
candle
there
goes
the
old
washerwoman
over
the
way
said
his
mother
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
the
poor
woman
can
hardly
drag
herself
along
and
she
must
now
drag
the
pail
home
from
the
fountain
be
a
good
boy
tukey
and
run
across
and
help
the
old
woman
won’t
you
so
tuk
ran
over
quickly
and
helped
her
but
when
he
came
back
again
into
the
room
it
was
quite
dark
and
as
to
a
light
there
was
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
was
now
to
go
to
bed
that
was
an
old
turn-up
bedstead
in
it
he
lay
and
thought
about
his
geography
lesson
and
of
zealand
and
of
all
that
his
master
had
told
him
he
ought
to
be
sure
to
have
read
over
his
lesson
again
but
that
you
know
he
could
not
do
he
therefore
put
his
geography-book
under
his
pillow
because
he
had
heard
that
was
a
very
good
thing
to
do
when
one
wants
to
learn
one’s
lesson
but
one
cannot
however
rely
upon
it
entirely
well
there
he
lay
and
thought
and
thought
and
all
at
once
it
was
just
as
if
someone
kissed
his
eyes
and
mouth
he
slept
and
yet
he
did
not
sleep
it
was
as
though
the
old
washerwoman
gazed
on
him
with
her
mild
eyes
and
said
it
were
a
great
sin
if
you
were
not
to
know
your
lesson
tomorrow
morning
you
have
aided
me
i
therefore
will
now
help
you
and
the
loving
god
will
do
so
at
all
times
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
book
under
tuk’s
pillow
began
scraping
and
scratching

came

she
and

she
related
how

there

about

which
after
all
was

there

an

came
from

she
had
an

now
related

all
at

she
cowered

poor
thing
said
the
old
poet
as
he
went
to
open
the
door
there
stood
a
little
boy
quite
naked
and
the
water
ran
down
from
his
long
golden
hair
he
trembled
with
cold
and
had
he
not
come
into
a
warm
room
he
would
most
certainly
have
perished
in
the
frightful
tempest
poor
child
said
the
old
poet
as
he
took
the
boy
by
the
hand
come
in
come
in
and
i
will
soon
restore
thee
thou
shalt
have
wine
and
roasted
apples
for
thou
art
verily
a
charming
child
and
the
boy
was
so
really
his
eyes
were
like
two
bright
stars
and
although
the
water
trickled
down
his
hair
it
waved
in
beautiful
curls
he
looked
exactly
like
a
little
angel
but
he
was
so
pale
and
his
whole
body
trembled
with
cold
he
had
a
nice
little
bow
in
his
hand
but
it
was
quite
spoiled
by
the
rain
and
the
tints
of
his
many-colored
arrows
ran
one
into
the
other
the
old
poet
seated
himself
beside
his
hearth
and
took
the
little
fellow
on
his
lap
he
squeezed
the
water
out
of
his
dripping
hair
warmed
his
hands
between
his
own
and
boiled
for
him
some
sweet
wine
then
the
boy
recovered
his
cheeks
again
grew
rosy
he
jumped
down
from
the
lap
where
he
was
sitting
and
danced
round
the
kind
old
poet
you
are
a
merry
fellow
said
the
old
man
what’s
your
name
my
name
is
cupid
answered
the
boy
don’t
you
know
me
there
lies
my
bow
it
shoots
well
i
can
assure
you
look
the
weather
is
now
clearing
up
and
the
moon
is
shining
clear
again
through
the
window
why
your
bow
is
quite
spoiled
said
the
old
poet
that
were
sad
indeed
said
the
boy
and
he
took
the
bow
in
his
hand
and
examined
it
on
every
side
oh
it
is
dry
again
and
is
not
hurt
at
all
the
string
is
quite
tight
i
will
try
it
directly
and
he
bent
his
bow
took
aim
and
shot
an
arrow
at
the
old
poet
right
into
his
heart
you
see
now
that
my
bow
was
not
spoiled
said
he
laughing
and
away
he
ran
the
naughty
boy
to
shoot
the
old
poet
in
that
way
he
who
had
taken
him
into
his
warm
room
who
had
treated
him
so
kindly
and
who
had
given
him
warm
wine
and
the
very
best
apples
the
poor
poet
lay
on
the
earth
and
wept
for
the
arrow
had
really
flown
into
his
heart
fie
said
he
how
naughty
a
boy
cupid
is
i
will
tell
all
children
about
him
that
they
may
take
care
and
not

him

them

many
a
heartache
and
all
good
children
to
whom
he
related
this
story
took
great
heed
of

naughty
cupid

he
made

of
them
still

he

astonishingly
cunning

come
from
the
lectures
he
runs
beside
them
in
a
black
coat
and
with
a
book
under

arm
it
is
quite
impossible
for
them
to
know
him
and
they
walk
along
with
him
arm
in
arm
as
if
he
too
were
a
student
like
themselves
and
then
unperceived
he
thrusts
an
arrow
to
their
bosom
when
the
young
maidens
come
from
being
examined
by
the

the
red
shoes
there
was
once
a
little
girl
who
was
very
pretty
and
delicate
but
in
summer
she
was
forced
to
run
about
with
bare
feet
she
was
so
poor
and
in
winter
wear
very
large
wooden
shoes
which
made
her
little
insteps
quite
red
and
that
looked
so
dangerous
in
the
middle
of
the
village
lived
old
dame
shoemaker
she
sat
and
sewed
together
as
well
as
she
could
a
little
pair
of
shoes
out
of
old
red
strips
of
cloth
they
were
very
clumsy
but
it
was
a
kind
thought
they
were
meant
for
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
was
called
karen
on
the
very
day
her
mother
was
buried
karen
received
the
red
shoes
and
wore
them
for
the
first
time
they
were
certainly
not
intended
for
mourning
but
she
had
no
others
and
with
stockingless
feet
she
followed
the
poor
straw
coffin
in
them
suddenly
a
large
old
carriage
drove
up
and
a
large
old
lady
sat
in
it
she
looked
at
the
little
girl
felt
compassion
for
her
and
then
said
to
the
clergyman
here
give
me
the
little
girl
i
will
adopt
her
and
karen
believed
all
this
happened
on
account
of
the
red
shoes
but
the
old
lady
thought
they
were
horrible
and
they
were
burnt
but
karen
herself
was
cleanly
and
nicely
dressed
she
must
learn
to
read
and
sew
and
people
said
she
was
a
nice
little
thing
but
the
looking-glass
said
thou
art
more
than
nice
thou
art
beautiful
now
the
queen
once
travelled
through
the
land
and
she
had
her
little
daughter
with
her
and
this
little
daughter
was
a
princess
and
people
streamed
to
the
castle
and
karen
was
there
also
and
the
little
princess
stood
in
her
fine
white
dress
in
a
window
and
let
herself
be
stared
at
she
had
neither
a
train
nor
a
golden
crown
but
splendid
red
morocco
shoes
they
were
certainly
far
handsomer
than
those
dame
shoemaker
had
made
for
little
karen
nothing
in
the
world
can
be
compared
with
red
shoes
now
karen
was
old
enough
to
be
confirmed
she
had
new
clothes
and
was
to
have
new
shoes
also
the
rich
shoemaker
in
the
city
took
the
measure
of
her
little
foot
this
took
place
at
his
house
in
his
room
where
stood
large
glass-cases
filled
with
elegant
shoes
and
brilliant
boots
all
this
looked
charming
but
the
old
lady
could
not
see
well
and
so
had
no
pleasure
in
them
in
the
midst
of
the
shoes
stood
a
pair
of
red
ones
just
like
those
the
princess
had
worn
how
beautiful
they
were
the
shoemaker
said
also
they
had
been
made
for
the
child
of
a
count
but
had
not
fitted
that
must
be
patent
leather
said
the
old
lady
they
shine
so
yes
they
shine
said
karen
and
they
fitted
and
were
bought
but
the
old
lady
knew
nothing
about
their
being
red
else
she
would
never
have
allowed
karen
to
have
gone
in
red
shoes
to
be
confirmed
yet
such
was
the
case
everybody
looked
at
her
feet
and
when
she
stepped
through
the
chancel
door
on
the
church
pavement
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
old
figures
on
the
tombs
those
portraits
of
old
preachers
and
preachers’
wives
with
stiff
ruffs
and
long
black
dresses
fixed
their
eyes
on
her
red
shoes
and
she
thought
only
of
them
as
the
clergyman
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
and
spoke
of
the
holy
baptism
of
the
covenant
with
god
and
how
she
should
be
now
a
matured
christian
and
the
organ
pealed
so
solemnly
the
sweet
children’s
voices
sang
and
the
old
music-directors
sang
but
karen
only
thought
of
her
red
shoes
in
the
afternoon
the
old
lady
heard
from
everyone
that
the
shoes
had
been
red
and
she
said
that
it
was
very
wrong
of
karen
that
it
was
not
at
all
becoming
and
that
in
future
karen
should
only
go

black
shoes
to
church
even
when
she
should
be
older
the
next
sunday
there
was
the
sacrament
and
karen
looked
at
the
black
shoes
looked
at
the
red
ones—looked
at
them
again
and
put
on
the
red
shoes
the
sun
shone
gloriously
karen
and
the
old
lady
walked
along
the
path
through
the
corn
it
was
rather
dusty
there
at
the
church
door
stood
an
old
soldier
with
a
crutch
and
with
a
wonderfully
long
beard
which
was
more
red
than
white
and
he
bowed
to
the
ground
and
asked
the
old
lady
whether
he
might
dust
her
shoes
and
karen
stretched
out
her
little
foot
see
what
beautiful
dancing
shoes
said
the
soldier
sit
firm
when
you
dance
and
he
put
his
hand
out
towards
the
soles
and
the
old
lady
gave
the
old
soldier
alms
and
went
into
the
church
with
karen
and
all
the
people
in
the
church
looked
at
karen’s
red
shoes
and
all
the
pictures
and
as
karen
knelt
before
the
altar
and
raised
the
cup
to
her
lips
she
only
thought
of
the
red
shoes
and
they
seemed
to
swim
in
it
and
she
forgot
to
sing
her
psalm
and
she
forgot
to
pray
our
father
in
heaven
now
all
the
people
went
out
of
church
and
the
old
lady
got
into
her
carriage
karen
raised
her
foot
to
get
in
after
her
when
the
old
soldier
said
look
what
beautiful
dancing
shoes
and
karen
could
not
help
dancing
a
step
or
two
and
when
she
began
her
feet
continued
to
dance
it
was
just
as
though
the
shoes
had
power
over
them
she
danced
round
the
church
corner
she
could
not
leave
off
the
coachman
was
obliged
to
run
after
and
catch
hold
of
her
and
he
lifted
her
in
the
carriage
but
her
feet
continued
to
dance
so
that
she
trod
on
the
old
lady
dreadfully
at
length
she
took
the
shoes
off
and
then
her
legs
had
peace
the
shoes
were
placed
in
a
closet
at
home
but
karen
could
not
avoid
looking
at
them
now
the
old
lady
was
sick
and
it
was
said
she
could
not
recover
she
must
be
nursed
and
waited
upon
and
there
was
no
one
whose
duty
it
was
so
much
as
karen’s
but
there
was
a
great
ball
in
the
city
to
which
karen
was
invited
she
looked
at
the
old
lady
who
could
not
recover
she
looked
at
the
red
shoes
and
she
thought
there
could
be
no
sin
in
it
she
put
on
the
red
shoes
she
might
do
that
also
she
thought
but
then
she
went
to
the
ball
and
began
to
dance
when
she
wanted
to
dance
to
the
right
the
shoes
would
dance
to
the
left
and
when
she
wanted
to
dance
up
the
room
the
shoes
danced
back
again
down
the
steps
into
the
street
and
out
of
the
city
gate
she
danced
and
was
forced
to
dance
straight
out
into
the
gloomy
wood
then
it
was
suddenly
light
up
among
the
trees
and
she
fancied
it
must
be
the
moon
for
there
was
a
face
but
it
was
the
old
soldier
with
the
red
beard
he
sat
there
nodded
his
head
and
said
look
what
beautiful
dancing
shoes
then
she
was
terrified
and
wanted
to
fling
off
the
red
shoes
but
they
clung
fast
and
she
pulled
down
her
stockings
but
the
shoes
seemed
to
have
grown
to
her
feet
and
she
danced
and
must
dance
over
fields
and
meadows
in
rain
and
sunshine
by
night
and
day
but
at
night
it
was
the
most
fearful
she
danced
over
the
churchyard
but
the
dead
did
not
dance—they
had
something
better
to
do
than
to
dance
she
wished
to
seat
herself
on
a
poor
man’s
grave
where
the
bitter
tansy
grew
but
for
her
there
was
neither
peace
nor
rest
and
when
she
danced
towards
the
open
church
door
she
saw

angel
standing
there
he
wore
long
white
garments
he
had
wings
which
reached
from
his
shoulders
to
the
earth
his
countenance
was
severe
and
grave
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
sword
broad
and
glittering
dance
shalt
thou
said
he
dance
in
thy
red
shoes
till
thou
art
pale
and
cold
till
thy
skin
shrivels
up
and
thou
art
a
skeleton
dance
shalt
thou
from
door
to
door
and
where
proud
vain
children
dwell
thou
shalt
knock
that
they
may
hear
thee
and
tremble
dance
shalt
thou
mercy
cried
karen
but
she
did
not
hear
the
angel’s
reply
for
the
shoes
carried
her
through
the
gate
into
the
fields
across
roads
and
bridges
and
she
must
keep
ever
dancing
one
morning
she
danced
past
a
door
which
she
well
knew
within
sounded
a
psalm
a
coffin
decked
with
flowers
was
borne
forth
then
she
knew
that
the
old
lady
was
dead
and
felt
that
she
was
abandoned
by
all
and
condemned
by
the
angel
of
god
she
danced
and
she
was
forced
to
dance
through
the
gloomy
night
the
shoes
carried
her
over
stack
and
stone
she
was
torn
till
she
bled
she
danced
over
the
heath
till
she
came
to
a
little
house
here
she
knew
dwelt
the
executioner
and
she
tapped
with
her
fingers
at
the
window
and
said
come
out
come
out
i
cannot
come
in
for
i
am
forced
to
dance
and
the
executioner
said
thou
dost
not
know
who
i
am
i
fancy
i
strike
bad
people’s
heads
off
and
i
hear
that
my
axe
rings
don’t
strike
my
head
off
said
karen
then
i
can’t
repent
of
my
sins
but
strike
off
my
feet
in
the
red
shoes
and
then
she
confessed
her
entire
sin
and
the
executioner
struck
off
her
feet
with
the
red
shoes
but
the
shoes
danced
away
with
the
little
feet
across
the
field
into
the
deep
wood
and
he
carved
out
little
wooden
feet
for
her
and
crutches
taught
her
the
psalm
criminals
always
sing
and
she
kissed
the
hand
which
had
wielded
the
axe
and
went
over
the
heath
now
i
have
suffered
enough
for
the
red
shoes
said
she
now
i
will
go
into
the
church
that
people
may
see
me
and
she
hastened
towards
the
church
door
but
when
she
was
near
it
the
red
shoes
danced
before
her
and
she
was
terrified
and
turned
round
the
whole
week
she
was
unhappy
and
wept
many
bitter
tears
but
when
sunday
returned
she
said
well
now
i
have
suffered
and
struggled
enough
i
really
believe
i
am
as
good
as
many
a
one
who
sits
in
the
church
and
holds
her
head
so
high
and
away
she
went
boldly
but
she
had
not
got
farther
than
the
churchyard
gate
before
she
saw
the
red
shoes
dancing
before
her
and
she
was
frightened
and
turned
back
and
repented
of
her
sin
from
her
heart
and
she
went
to
the
parsonage
and
begged
that
they
would
take
her
into
service
she
would
be
very
industrious
she
said
and
would
do
everything
she
could
she
did
not
care
about
the
wages
only
she
wished
to
have
a
home
and
be
with
good
people
and
the
clergyman’s
wife
was
sorry
for
her
and
took
her
into
service
and
she
was
industrious
and
thoughtful
she
sat
still
and
listened
when
the
clergyman
read
the
bible
in
the
evenings
all
the
children
thought
a
great
deal
of
her
but
when
they
spoke
of
dress
and
grandeur
and
beauty
she
shook
her
head
the
following
sunday
when
the
family
was
going
to
church
they
asked
her
whether
she
would
not
go
with
them
but
she
glanced
sorrowfully
with
tears
in
her
eyes
at
her
crutches
the
family
went
to
hear
the
word
of
god
but
she
went
alone
into
her
little
chamber
there
was
only
room
for
a
bed
and
chair
to
stand
in
it
and
here
she
sat
down
with
her
prayer-book
and
whilst
she
read
with
a
pious
mind
the
wind
bore
the
strains
of
the
organ
towards
her
and
she
raised

countenance
and
said
o
god
help
me
and
the
sun
shone
so
clearly
and
straight
before
her
stood
the
angel
of
god
in
white
garments
the
same
she
had
seen
that
night
at
the
church
door
but
he
no
longer
carried
the
sharp
sword
but
in
its
stead
a
splendid
green
spray
full
of
roses
and
he
touched
the
ceiling
with
the
spray
and
the
ceiling
rose
so
high
and
where
he
had
touched
it
there
gleamed
a
golden
star
and
he
touched
the
walls
and
they
widened
out
and
she
saw
the
organ
which
was
playing
she
saw
the
old
pictures
of
the
preachers
and
the
preachers’
wives
the
congregation
sat
in
cushioned
seats
and
sang
out
of
their
prayer-books
for
the
church
itself
had
come
to
the
poor
girl
in
her
narrow
chamber
or
else
she
had
come
into
the
church
she
sat
in
the
pew
with
the
clergyman’s
family
and
when
they
had
ended
the
psalm
and
looked
up
they
nodded
and
said
it
is
right
that
thou
art
come
it
was
through
mercy
she
said
and
the
organ
pealed
and
the
children’s
voices
in
the
choir
sounded
so
sweet
and
soft
the
clear
sunshine
streamed
so
warmly
through
the
window
into
the
pew
where
karen
sat
her
heart
was
so
full
of
sunshine
peace
and
joy
that
it
broke
her
soul
flew
on
the
sunshine
to
god
and
there
no
one
asked
after
the
red
shoes

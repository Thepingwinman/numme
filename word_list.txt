the

addresses
writing
studies
in
a
broad
sense
consistent
with
the
wide
ranging
approaches
characteristic
of
teaching
and
scholarship
in
writing
across
the

the

presents
works
that
take
divergent
perspectives
on
working
as
a
writer
teaching
writing
administering
writing
programs
and
studying
writing
in

the

committed
to
the
principle
that
knowledge
should
freely
circulate
we
see
the
opportunities
that
new
technologies
have
for
further
democratizing
knowledge
and
we
see
that
to
share
the
power
of
writing
is
to
share
the
means
for
all
to
articulate

who
these
books
are
for
this
is
the
first
of
two
books
for
teachers
about
the
english
language
we
be
lieve
that
all
teachers
not
just
english
teachers
share
the
responsibility
for
helping
students
develop
their
abilities
to
speak
read
and
write
students
must
learn
to
communicate
appropriately
about
math
chemistry
history
and
every
other
school
subject
teaching
students
these
skills
necessarily
ex
tends
across
the
curriculum
thus
while
one
part
of
our
intended
audience
is
english
k
teachers
we
have
prepared
this
book
and
its
companion
with
teachers
and
student
teachers
from
all
disciplines
in
mind
how
to
use
these
books
in
these
books
we
use
certain
typographical
marks
to
help
you
focus
on
key
points
important
terms
are
bolded
you
can
find
their
definitions
in
the
text
and
in
the
glossary
examples
are
noted
in
italics
or
are
separated
from
the
text
what
these
books
are
about
these
books
are
about
language
but
specifically
about
the
english
language
delahunty
and
garvey
and
its
uses
the
first
book
is
about
the
grammar
of
english
the
second
is
about
related
topics
including
language
variation
e.g
dialects
language
learning
english
spelling
and
the
history
of
the
english
language
generally
when
people
hear
the
word
grammar
they
immediately
think
of
correct
or
incorrect
and
good
or
bad
language
thinking
about
language
in
this
way
is
said
to
be
prescriptive
english
has
a
long
tradition
of
judging
some
expressions
as
correct
and
others
as
incorrect
for
example
expressions
such
as
we
was
are
viewed
as
incorrect
even
though
a
great
many
people
use
them
the
correct
version
is
said
to
be
we
were
counter-posed
to
the
prescriptive
tradition
is
the
descriptive
one
which
developed
in
linguistics
anthropology
and
sociology
this
approach
is
concerned
with
describing
and
understanding
the
linguistic
behavior
of
a
community
without
judging
it
from
a
descriptive
point
of
view
we
was
is
unobjectionable
when
used
by
a
member
of
a
community
of
speakers
who
characteristically
use
this
expression
however
it
is
unacceptable
to
the
wider
english
speaking
community
in
for
example
formal
speaking
and
writing
the
point
of
view
presented
in
these
books
is
essentially
descriptive
however
except
where
the
topic
is
explicitly
about
linguistic
variation
we
describe
the
form
of
english
used
in
relatively
formal
public
speaking
and
writing
we
recognize
that
language
changes
and
that
consequently
even
the
prescriptive
rules
have
to
change
we
believe
that
these
rules
should
be
descriptions
of
the
best
accepted
practices
of
the
day
rather
than
imposi
tions
often
irrelevant
on
the
language
and
its
use
communication
communication
occurs
when
one
person
acts
with
the
intention
of
influ
encing
the
mind
of
another
for
example
by
getting
him/her
to
entertain
some
idea
and
when
that
other
person
recognizes
the
first
person’s
inten
tion
to
influence
his/her
mind
clearly
it
is
possible
to
influence
another
person’s
mind
unintentionally
for
instance
if
i
unintentionally
sneeze
i
might
prompt
you
to
think
that
i
might
have
a
cold
however
this
is
a
rather
different
kind
of
event
than
one
in
which
i
intentionally
sneeze
and
you
recognize
that
my
sneeze
was
intentional
from
my
first
unintentional
sneeze
you
cannot
infer
that
i
am
trying
to
get
you
to
think
i
have
a
cold
from
my
second
intentional
sneeze
you
can
infer
that
i
am
trying
to
get
you
to
think
something
or
another
perhaps
that
i
have
a
cold
imagine
that
we
have
gone
to
a
party
together
and
that
we
want
to
co
ordinate
our
leaving
so
before
we
get
to
the
party
i
say
to
you
i’ll
pre
introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languagetend
to
sneeze
when
i’m
ready
to
go
home
and
you
agree
to
interpret
my
sneeze
in
this
way
when
i
sneeze
at
the
party
you
can
infer
that
i
sneezed
intentionally
and
interpret
my
sneeze
as
indicating
my
desire
to
leave
for
this
communication
to
succeed
two
elements
must
be
in
place
first
the
assumption
that
i
intend
to
influence
you
in
some
way
and
sec
ond
our
agreement
about
the
meaning
of
my
intentional
sneeze
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
sneeze
that
requires
it
to
mean
let’s
go
home
we
could
have
agreed
that
it
was
to
mean
it’s
safe
to
slip
upstairs
to
steal
the
host’s
jewelry
by
specifying
a
meaning
for
a
sneeze
we
have
created
a
little
code
a
sort
of
miniscule
language
language
fortunately
we
cannot
read
each
others’
minds
so
if
we
want
to
allow
some
one
access
to
what
we
are
thinking
we
must
provide
them
with
clues
that
they
can
perceive
language
is
a
system
that
connects
thoughts
which
can
not
be
heard
seen
or
touched
with
sounds
letters
manual
signs
or
tactile
symbols
e.g
braille
which
can
in
this
way
one
person’s
private
ideas
may
be
communicated
to
another
person
for
example
imagine
that
i
want
to
communicate
to
you
my
idea
that
my
study
needs
to
be
tidied
up
you
can’t
see
hear
touch
taste
or
otherwise
perceive
that
idea
it’s
locked
away
in
my
mind
to
communicate
it
to
you
i
have
to
cast
it
in
a
form
that
you
can
perceive—typically
in
spoken
visual
or
tactile
form—that
is
systematically
connected
to
the
idea
for
example
the
sentence
my
study
needs
to
be
tidied
up
without
this
perceivable
expression
you
cannot
know
that
i
have
an
idea
to
communicate
without
the
systematic
connection
between
the
idea
and
the
form
of
the
expression
you
cannot
know
which
idea
i
want
to
communicate
so
language
is
a
code
that
systematically
connects
private
thoughts
with
pub
lic
expressions
these
books
are
about
the
systems
we
use
to
connect
private
ideas
to
public
activities
language
has
been
a
major
topic
of
research
for
well
over
two
centuries
linguistic
research
intersects
with
anthropology
biology
computer
science
history
human
development
literature
philosophy
politics
psychology
as
well
as
reading
and
writing
discourse
when
we
communicate
we
engage
in
discourse
that
is
we
deploy
language
with
the
purpose
of
providing
our
audiences
with
clues
about
how
we
want
to
influence
them
all
discourse
takes
place
in
context
that
is
the
producer
of
a
piece
of
discourse
speaker/writer
purposefully
deploys
at
some
time
and
in
some
delahunty
and
garvey
place
clues
about
his
or
her
intention
which
are
to
be
interpreted
by
their
intended
recipient(s
audience
the
clues
have
generally
been
selected
with
that
audience
in
that
time
and
place
and
with
those
purposes
in
mind
some
scholars
argue
that
because
different
discourse
situations
require
different
patterns
of
communicative
practice
we
must
speak
of
discours
es
rather
than
of
discourse
gee
we
have
for
instance
the
discourse
in
which
we
are
currently
engaged—the
discourse
of
linguistics
which
differs
from
the
discourse
of
literary
study
which
differs
from
the
dis
course
of
chemical
engineering
which
differs
from
the
discourse
of
history
and
so
on
a
student
who
aims
to
be
a
practitioner
in
a
field
must
master
the
ways
in
which
practitioners
in
that
field
communicate
with
each
other
about
topics
in
the
field
recognizing
these
specialized
communicative
practices
has
given
rise
to
the
writing
across
the
curriculum
wac
movement
text
when
people
communicate
they
produce
texts
texts
always
occur
in
some
medium
which
may
be
auditory
visual
tactile
or
some
combina
tion
of
these
texts
also
always
occur
in
some
channel
that
is
the
environ
ment
through
which
the
medium
travels
from
the
text’s
producer(s
to
its
receiver(s
for
ordinary
face-to
face
conversation
the
medium
is
the
air
which
is
set
in
motion
by
the
producer
and
whose
motions
affect
the
ears
of
the
receiver(s
communication
by
telephone
involves
at
least
two
chan
nels—the
air
between
the
speaker’s
mouth
and
the
phone
the
mechanical
and
electronic
devices
that
connect
the
speaker’s
and
receiver’s
phones
and
the
air
between
the
receiver’s
phone
and
his/her
ear
texts
may
incorporate
non-linguistic
elements
such
as
pictures
diagrams
music
and
the
like
genre
a
genre
is
a
communicative
category
genres
differ
from
each
other
in
partici
pants
forms
and
purposes
texts
come
in
genres
for
example
a
shakespear
ean
sonnet
is
a
different
type
of
text
from
a
business
letter
which
is
a
different
type
of
text
from
a
casual
conversation
communicative
acts
come
in
genres
too
the
sales
pitch
of
a
car
salesman
differs
from
an
end-of-term
class
presentation
which
differs
from
texting
a
party
invitation
to
a
friend
the
various
discourses
require
their
own
specific
genres
for
example
the
discourse
of
creative
writing
in
english
includes
the
genres
of
the
short
story
the
novel
and
poetry
which
includes
such
sub-genres
as
the
lyric
and
the
dramatic
monologue
the
discourse
of
business
includes
the
annual
report
various
kinds
of
advertisements
and
business
letters
introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languageideology
many
scholars
stress
the
power
of
discourse
and
language
to
influence
speak
ers’
perceptions
and
conceptualizations
of
their
worlds
and
to
create
and
maintain
the
structures
of
their
societies
educators
interested
in
language
emphasize
its
power
to
create
and
maintain
ideologies
i.e
beliefs
about
the
ways
in
which
goods
are
distributed
in
society
goods
are
anything
that
the
people
in
the
society
generally
believe
are
beneficial
to
have
or
harmful
not
to
have
whether
this

‘good’

‘good’

language
in
education
language
is
central
to
education
it
is
the
means
by
which
educational
con
tent
is
communicated
it
is
an
object
of
study
it
is
an
object
of
beliefs
that
are
important
in
education
it
is
a
key
element
of
students’
identities
it
poses
potential
problems
in
education
largely
because
of
the
beliefs
we
have
about
it
and
it
is
a
valuable
resource
for
those
who
know
how
to
make
use
of
it
language
is
a
means
of
education
in
that
it
is
the
primary
medium
of
communication
between
students
and
teachers
and
between
students
and
textbooks
language
is
an
object
of
education
because
it
is
the
material
out
of
which
texts
are
woven
and
because
language
itself
is
the
object
of
study
in
writ
ing
and
speaking
courses
we
focus
on
language
as
we
learn
to
edit
our
essays
and
speeches
we
develop
our
vocabularies
and
learn
the
meanings
uses
and
conventional
spellings
of
words
we
learn
to
control
the
genres
required
for
various
disciplines
and
the
specific
characteristics
expected
in
those
genres
for
example
personal
essays
academic
papers
of
various
sorts
business
letters
reports
and
magazine
articles
language
is
also
an
object
of
study
in
so
far
as
we
develop
our
skills
in
using
it
to
communicate
to
acquire
knowledge
from
lectures
and
books
to
integrate
new
information
with
old
to
replace
false
beliefs
with
new
true
ones
and
to
increase
or
de
crease
our
estimates
of
the
likelihood
that
some
belief
we
hold
is
true
it
is
important
to
note
here
that
students
who
are
learning
english
as
a
sec
ond
language
labor
under
a
double
burden
because
english
is
simultaneously
both
the
means
and
an
object
of
their
education
exercise
when
asked
what
she
thought
was
the
most
important
aspect
of
learn
ing
english
as
a
second
language
a
japanese
student
replied
knowing
delahunty
and
garvey
many
vocabularies
what
do
you
think
she
meant
is
her
expression
an
acceptable
piece
of
english
how
would
you
change
it
so
it
retains
her
apparent
meaning
and
is
acceptable
why
would
you
make
that
par
ticular
change
is
your
understanding
of
her
assertion
true
language
is
also
an
object
of
our
beliefs
many
people
believe
that
some
forms
of
english
are
good
and
others
bad
that
some
languages
are
beautiful
and
others
ugly
that
some
languages
are
limited
in
what
they
can
express
when
compared
to
languages
such
as
english
that
people
who
speak
certain
varieties
are
uneducated
perhaps
stupid
and
unworthy
of
certain
types
of
work
beliefs
like
these
constitute
ideologies
about
language
some
ideolo
gies
are
liberating
and
others
quite
oppressive
whether
liberating
or
op
pressive
they
must
become
objects
of
critical
awareness
for
teachers
and
of
critical
discussion
for
students
kress

language
also
represents
one
of
the
key
elements
of
our
students’
social
cultural
and
personal
identities
writing
explores
values
our
students
may
not
be
able
to
explore
otherwise
as
their
writing
improves
the
range
and
sophistication
of
these
identities
increases
teachers
have
potentially
powerful
effects
on
students’
lives
our
re
sponse
to
our
students’
language
will
influence
their
attitudes
young
chil
dren
have
a
fascination
with
language
and
almost
no
inhibitions
about
it
adults
in
contrast
typically
display
considerable
anxiety
about
their
language
they
often
have
strongly
negative
attitudes
towards
their
native
speech
pattern
labov
this
anxiety
is
known
as
linguistic
in
security
this
insecurity
does
not
develop
naturally
it
is
the
consequence
of
repeated
experiences
in
which
their
native
speech
patterns
are
dispar
aged
often
by
teachers
who
should
know
better
this
problem
is
par
ticularly
acute
for
students
who
are
not
native
speakers
of
english
or
who
do
not
speak

introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of

how
many
words
do
you
have
in
your
vocabulary
consider
first
your
active
vocabulary
i.e
words
you
use
regularly
in
speaking
and

such
as
often
then
estimate
your
passive
vocabulary
i.e

that
you
recognize
and
understand

which
don’t
come
readily
to
mind
when
you
want
them

prestidigitation
estimates
based
on
objective
study
appear
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
language
is
a
potential
problem
to
the
extent
that
it—or
our
beliefs
about
it—impedes
students’
learning
if
we
believe
that
students
who
speak
english
with
a
latino
accent
or
who
speak
black
english
a.k.a
ebonics
will
be
unable
to
keep
up
in
our
classes
then
very
likely
they
will
not
because
teach
ers’
expectations
strongly
affect
students’
success
in
school
because
teachers
respond
to
students’
language
on
many
levels
they
must
develop
a
critical
awareness
of
their
own
linguistic
preferences
prejudices
and
beliefs—ev
eryone
has
these
beliefs
even
linguists
they
must
also
be
able
to
critically
evaluate
textbooks
dictionaries
style
manuals
computerized
style
analyzers
and
newspaper
articles
on
language
because
these
also
embody
assumptions
about
language
many
of
them
just
plain
wrong
often
destructively
so
language
is
a
potential
resource
for
teaching
critical
thinking
we
can
evalu
ate
our
attitudes
about
other
languages
and
other
dialects
and
their
speak
ers
we
can
collect
linguistic
data
observe
its
patterns
and
articulate
those
patterns
as
hypotheses
which
we
can
then
test
we
can
evaluate
the
ways
we
talk
about
language
for
their
precision
and
come
to
appreciate
the
value
of
precision
in
language
use
generally
language
data
for
analysis
is
very
readily
available
students
can
collect
their
own
data
from
bumper
stickers
license
plates
ads

schools
or
the

can
provide
comput
erized
collections
of
authentic
spoken
and
written
texts
corpora
along
with
computer
programs
to
analyze
them
concordancers
because
the
linguistic
study
of
language
is
fundamentally
scientific

in
this

can
provide
us
and
our
students
with
an
understanding
and
appreciation
of
scientific

essay
on
at

two
of
the
ways
in

that
inter

term

thinking
critically
about
language
clearly
teachers
must
know
about
reading
and
writing
as
well
as
about
teaching
their
disciplines
but
why
should
they
learn
about
language
one
answer
is
that
teachers
should
have
a
well-developed
critical
understand
ing
of
at
least
some
modern
thinking
about
the
nature
of
language
and
its
roles
in
education
because
reading
writing
and
all
subject
matters
crucially
depend
on
language
good
craftspeople
always
understand
their
materials
and
as
language
is
the
raw
material
of
the
discourses
of
all
disciplines
teach
ers
should
understand
its
nature

all
modern
approaches
to
reading
and

femi
nist
marxist
post-modernist
psychological—accord
language
a
central
place
third
because
the
linguistic
study
of
language
is
quite
different
in
its
ap
proaches
goals
and
methods
from
the
approaches
to
the
study
of
reading
or
writing
it
complements
those
approaches
fourth
societal

students’
and
parents’
can
profoundly
affect

ing
and
performance
one
of
our
goals
is
to
enable
you
to
think
critically
about
language
and
the
claims
of
those
who
write
about
it
including
ours
critical
thinking
has
many
facets
including
creating
and
evaluating
arguments
reasoning
from
premises
to
conclusions
and
detecting
covert
claims
in
arguments
in
lan
guage
study
we
think
critically
when
we
determine
whether
a
grammar
style
manual
or
dictionary
is
appropriate
for
our
students
or
whether
a
linguistic
claim
e.g
double
negatives
make
a
positive
has
any
validity
exercise
is
it
valid
to
say
that
double
negatives
make
a
positive
in
english
what
evidence
can
you
muster
for
your
decision
how
valid
is
your
evidence
critical
thinking
is
important
in
any
discipline
but
it
is
of
particular
im
portance
in
reading
and
writing
to
be
able
to
read
in
any
discipline
students
introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languagemust
know
how
to
accurately
interpret
the
language
of
texts
in
that
discipline
and
to
be
able
to
recreate
their
authors’
meanings
both
of
these
tasks
require
at
a
minimum
knowing
the
discipline’s
technical
terms
some
disciplines
may
require
readers
to
be
knowledgeable
about
further
aspects
of
the
language
literature
students
for
instance
must
be
able
to
understand
language
made
difficult
by
archaisms
rhetorical
figures
complex
grammar
and
willful
gram
matical
and
semantic
violations
dillon
when
writing
students
think
critically
when
they
analyze
their
personal
preconceptions
and
biases
when
they
assess
the
relevance
and
effectiveness
of
their
ideas
and
when
they
decide
on
the
best
linguistic
formulation
of
those
ideas
for
their
intended
audiences
the
ability
to
think
critically
about
language
is
particularly
needed
now
because
the
school
grammar
tradition
has
generally
become
quite
unin
formed
about
research
into
current
english
discourse
practices
the
respon
sibility
for
this
situation
lies
partly
with
linguists
themselves
we
have
not
been
successful
in
our
efforts
to
educate
the
public
about
language
how
ever
the
greatest
share
of
the
responsibility
lies
with
institutions
journalists
and
teachers
who
have
vigorously
defended
an
ultra-conservative
status
quo
who
know
little
if
anything
about
language
and
who
often
misconstrue
what
linguists
have
to
say
about
it
many
believe
for
instance
that
linguists
claim
that
anything
goes
in
english
these
days
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
as
we
will
show
in
our
chapter
on
conceptions
of
language
standard
english
learning
to
read
and
write
is
partly
a
matter
of
linguistic
development
i.e
the
growth
in
a
student’s
ability
to
communicate
appropriately
in
an
in
creasingly
broad
range
of
circumstances
teachers
who
concern
themselves
with
the
linguistic
development
of
their
students
typically
view
their
role
as
twofold
a
to
promote
their
students’
ability
to
speak
read
and
write
in
their
disciplines
and
b
to

probably
answered
exercise

by
saying
that
grammar
tells
us
which
expressions
are
correct
you
would
of
course
have
meant
prescrip
tive
grammar
however
linguists
add
at
least
two
other
interpretations
to
the
word
first
they
use
it
to
refer
to
the
knowledge
that
a
speaker
or
writer
of
a
language
must
have
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
the
language
at
all
second
they
use
it
to
refer
to
any
attempt
to
describe
that
knowledge
we
will
return
to
these
issues
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
discuss
prescriptive
and
descrip
tive
approaches
to
language
study
more
thoroughly
it
is
important
when
we
speak
about
grammar
that
we
are
clear
to
ourselves
and
our
audiences
which
meaning
of
grammar
we
intend
this
first
book
is
about
the
grammar
of
english
some
of
our
readers
will
be
required
to
teach
grammar
classes
per
se
others
will
use
information
about
english
grammar
while
teaching
composition
and
still
others
will
use
it
while
teaching
writing-intensive
classes
across
the
curriculum
it
is
important
to
note
that
grammar
refers
only
to
a
part
of
language
and
that
these
books
deal
with
language
not
just
grammar
we
believe
that
a
teacher’s
knowledge
of
language
is
far
more
broadly
relevant
than
just
knowledge
of
grammar
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
teaching
grammar
is
highly
con
troversial
to
get
a
sense
of
the
arguments
we
recommend
that
you
read

of
either
by
the
time
you
have
read
these
books
however
we
do
know
that
in
discussions
about
how
to
teach
writing
you
will
hear
arguments
that
teaching
grammar
out
of
context
does
not
improve
students’
writing
generally
what
is
meant
by
grammar
in
those
discussions
is
the
set
of
pre
scriptive
conventions
for
speaking
and
writing
standard
english
certainly
there
is
a
large
body
of
research
going
back
more
than
a
century
purporting
to
support
this
position
however
we
repeat
these
books
are
not
just
about
grammar
they
are
about
language
including
how
grammar
fits
into
lan
guage
it
is
as
important
for
teachers
to
know
about
language
as
it
is
to
know
about
their
subject
matter
a
teacher
who
knows
nothing
about
language
is
a
cyclist
without
wheels
worse
a
teacher
who
knows
nothing
about
lan
guage
is
a
chemist
who
knows
and
cares
nothing
about
the
environmental
consequences
of
the
substances
he
or
she
creates
our
approach
to
the
study
of
language
is
heavily
influenced
by
the
results
of
recent
linguistic
research
and
methods
this
allows
us
to
tie
our
discussion
to
critical
thinking
literature
writing
across
the
curriculum
and
composi
tion
studies
as
well
as
to
philosophy
and
the
social
psychological
neurologi
cal
and
computer
sciences
see
t
raugott
and
pratt
as
well
as
journals
like
english
journal
and
style
most
of
this
book
deals
with
english
grammar
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
general
public
expects
teachers
to
have
a
mastery
of
grammar
by
which
is
usually
meant
prescriptive
grammar
you
will
probably
be
expected
to
teach
the
subject
in
one
way
or
another
we
do
not
suggest
that
you
use
this
book
as
a
syllabus
it
contains
too
much
material
and
is
not
geared
to
a
junior
or
senior
high-school
audience
nonetheless
in
spite
of
the
amount
of
material
it
covers
it’s
merely
a
good
basis
for
continuing
your
study
of
language
we
hope
that
you
will
find
the
analytic
and
critical
methods
of
exploring
language
used
in
the
books
to
be
more
productive
and
interesting
than
the
more
con
ventional
handbook
approach—exposition
plus
drill-and-practice
more
importantly
we
hope
that
you
will
present
to
your
students
the
broader
conceptions
about
language
that
are
expressed
in
these
books
these
conceptions
are
presented
initially
in
our
chapter
on
conceptions
of
language
but
are
developed
in
various
ways
in
other
chapters
delahunty
and
garvey
other
reasons
for
studying
and
teaching
about
language
besides
its
importance
in
the
development
of
critical
thinking
skills
there
are
many
other
reasons
for
studying
language
you
might
want
to
know
about
language
variation
dialects
of
various
sorts
about
how
languages
change
over
time
about
the
history
of
english
about
the
standardization
of
languages
about
how
languages
are
learned
about
language
disorders
about
the
relationships
between
language
and
culture
or
society
or
about
how
computers
are
programmed
to
understand
or
produce
language
these
are
all
to
one
degree
or
another
relevant
to
teachers
and
we
deal
with
many
of
them
in
these
books
deciding
what
should
be
included
in
books
like
these
is
remarkably
dif
ficult
we
have
followed
the
guidelines
of
the
national
council
of
teachers
of
english
ncte
and
the
national
council
for
accreditation
for
teacher
education
ncate
about
what
english
teachers
should
know
and
we
depended
on
the
research
on
writing
across
the
curriculum
wac
none
theless
because
such
a
huge
amount
is
known
about
language
generally
and
about
english
in
particular
and
because
as
in
any
area
of
vigorous
intellectual
activity
there
are
many
competing
approaches
to
these
topics
it
would
be
impossible
to
synopsize
them
all
here
in
the
first
book
we
pres
ent
a
grammar
of
english
which
addresses
traditional
topics
and
concerns
but
which
is
influenced
considerably
by
current
grammatical
and
discourse
research
in
the
second
book
we
present
a
range
of
topics
that
we
hope
will
be
of
interest
and
value
to
teachers
across
the
disciplines
fulfilling
the
goals
of
instruction
becomes
particularly
important
in
a
world
growing
in
technological
complexity
social
diversity
and
multiple
english
es
see
the
essays
in
kachru
and
kachru
and
nelson
as
well
as
crystal
jenkins
mcarthur
melchers
and
shaw
many
students
are
passionate
about
their
studies
in
literature
the
physical
and
social
sciences
business
or
in
other
intellectual
pursuits
unfortunately
however
many
students
and
teachers
see
the
study
of
language
as
merely
the
study
of
correct
grammar
we
have
already
begun
to
sift
through
the
various
meanings
of
grammar
and
will
develop
this
discussion
in
later
chapters
teachers
face
a
complex
set
of
responsibilities
parents
boards
of
educa
tion
and
legislators
look
increasingly
to
school
systems
to
prepare
students
for
the
demands
of
the
future
worries
that
american
students
lag
behind
those
of
other
developed
countries
translate
directly
into
concerns
about
pub
lic
funding
i.e
taxes
and
accountability
in
education
as
the
no
child
left
behind
act
requires
these
pressures
appear
in
the
form
of
demands
for
suc
cess
on
standardized
tests
for
getting
back
to
basics
for
public
funding
of
introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languageprivate
education
vouchers
and
charter
schools
for
longer
school
years
for
ongoing
competency
testing
for
teachers
and
for
the
assessment
and
rank
ing
of
schools
from
our
perspective
teachers’
responsibility
is
to
their
students
we
must
meet
the
needs
of
the
learner
rather
than
simply
present
material
on
a
take-it-or-leave-it
basis
as
a
result
the
learnability
of
classroom
mate
rial
becomes
more
important
than
its
teachability
how
easily
it
can
be
taught
or
its
assessability
how
easily
it
can
be
assessed
moreover
in
the
coming
generation
the
diversity
of
its
students
in
us
classrooms
will
change
dramatically
the
us
census
bureau
projected
percentages
for
the
major
racial/ethnic
groups
are
displayed
in

national

projections
in
the
percentage
of
the
us
population
born
abroad
was
these
projections
suggest
that
in
addition
to
knowing
their
disciplines
and
how
to
teach
them
ideally
by
incorporating
lots
of
writing
teachers
will
also
have
to
know
about
how
to
teach
esl
english
as
a
second
lan
guage
in
the
rest
of
this
introduction
we
will
explain
the
organization
of
these
books
and
provide
some
hints
for
working
successfully
with
them
the
organization
of
these
books
the
next
chapter
of
this
book
conceptions
of
language
is
on
the
nature
of
language
the
remaining
chapters
are
on
various
aspects
of
the
english
language
including
its
sound
system
its
vocabulary
its
parts
of
speech
word
meanings
and
the
ways
in
which
words
are
combined
into
phrases
clauses
and
sentences—essentially
the
grammar
of
english
book
i
gives
you
some
basic
information
about
english
grammar
about
how
to
do
simple
linguistic
analyses
and
about
thinking
critically
about
language
because
it
is
impossible
to
remember
the
analysis
of
every
expres
sion
you
might
be
asked
about
by
a
student
there
are
far
too
many
our
main
concern
is
to
help
you
become
independent
by
providing
you
with
the
means
to
do
linguistic
analysis
as
you
need
it
delahunty
and
garvey
we
regularly
use
an
analytic
method
in
which
we
formulate
criteria
for
determining
how
to
categorize
words
phrases
or
sentences
for
example
whenever
we
want
to
know
the
part
of
speech
of
a
particular
word
we
use
these
criteria
to
test
a
hypothesis
about
the
word’s
part
of
speech
we
will
ask
you
to
do
similar
activities
in
the
exercises
sometimes
by
gathering
data
sometimes
by
analyzing
material
that
lies
just
a
step
beyond
what
is
covered
in
the
text
book
ii
deals
with
selected
topics
of
particular
importance
to
teachers
spo
ken
and
written

usage
punctuation
history
of
the
english
language
and
language
acquisition
our
presentation
brings
together
current
studies
in
each
of
these
areas
and
prepares
you
to
read
applied
studies
that
you
will
encounter
in
your
career
these
chapters
can
be
read
independently
of
book
i
though
on
occasion
you
will
find
some
cross
references
to
chapters
in
book
i
along
with
some
phonetic
notation
that
may
send
you
back
to
our
chapter
on
phonetics
and
phonology
in
many
instances
we
will
mention
a
topic
briefly
discuss
it
and
return
to
it
in
greater
depth
later
our
hope
is
that
this
cycling
will
provide
you
with
an
opportunity
to
get
an
initial
familiarity
with
a
topic
and
then
build
on
that
familiarity
later
these
books
are
far
from
covering
the
wealth
of
information
on
topics
that
you
might
be
interested
in
as
a
teacher
to
survey
all
of
these
would
require
several
more
books
we
encourage
you
to
consult
your
instructor
for
further
references
and
bibliographical
resources
for
example
on
linguistics
and
litera
ture
composition
or
reading
hints
for
success
the
study
of
the
english
language
is
demanding
first
you
will
find
yourself
confronting
challenges
to
linguistic
assumptions
and
even
prejudices
that
have
become
ingrained
in
you
through
your
education
and
that
are
widely
accepted
without
critical
examination
by
the
majority
of
educated
english
speakers
second
you
may
find
yourself
in
a
mode
of
analysis
quite
different
from
that
of
your
own
studies
third
you
will
confront
considerable
lin
guistic
detail
and
the
large
number
of
new
terms
required
to
conceptualize
and
describe
it
while
we
cannot
guarantee
that
these
new
ideas
will
be
easy
to
master
although
many
people
do
find
them
so
we
believe
that
they
are
worth
your
effort
and
will
serve
you
well
in
your
career
because
what
you
will
learn
in
these
pages
is
as
much
skill
as
informa
tion
do
not
expect
to
master
this
material
in
a
single
reading
the
best
strategy
for
most
people
is
to
do
a
preliminary
reading
do
the
exercises
and
then
re
read
and
reread
again
research
on
learning
and
remembering
shows
what
introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languageis
perhaps
obvious—the
more
frequently
and
deeply
you
review
material
the
better
you
will
remember
and
understand
it
if
you
are
a
student
attend
class
and
ask
questions
if
you
are
having
difficulties
the
chances
are
good
that
many
of
your
classmates
are
too
and
will
benefit
from
the
instructor’s
answers
to
your
questions
exercises
are
scattered
throughout
the
book
we
encourage
you
to
tackle
as
many
as
possible
this
need
not
involve
working
them
out
in
full
detail
unless
your
instructor
requires
it
you
might
just
work
out
the
outline
of
a
solution
however
you
cannot
learn
the
analytic
skills
required
to
study
linguistics
or
grammar
without
doing
lots
of
hands-on
work
if
you
have
difficulties
with
a
problem
try
to
identify
them
as
specifically
as
possible
if
you
get
an
incorrect
answer
make
sure
also
to
get
an
explanation
of
the
correct
one
t
ry
to
retrace
the
thinking
that
led
you
to
miss
the
question
sometimes
you
can
learn
more
from
mistakes
than
from
perfection
one
of
our
goals
is
to
help
you
develop
your
skills
in
independent
language
analysis
teachers
are
regularly
called
upon
to
answer
questions
whose
answers
can
not
be
found
in
textbooks
or
reference
works
doing
exercises
is
essential
for
independence
t
erminology
is
plentiful
in
linguistics
just
as
in
every
other
discipline
remember
that
technical
terms
usually
have
specific
meanings
so
you
may
not
be
able
to
substitute
ordinary
words
for
them
we
have
provided
glos
saries
to
help
you
identify
definitions
you
should
consult
them
often
be
particularly
careful
with
terms
e.g
semantics
that
may
have
a
familiar
meaning
in
ordinary
language
but
a
significantly
different
one
in
technical
usage
definitions
should
be
supplemented
with
explanations
elaborations
of
the
minimal
statements
in
the
glossary
remember
though
to
use
precise
language
in
defining
terms
linguists
like
to
think
of
themselves
as
scientists
and
so
value
precision
and
accuracy
explanations
may
be
taken
from
the
text
or
from
class
notes
if
you
are
a
student
t
ry
to
have
a
specific
pro
totypical
example
of
each
term
select
an
example
that
is
clear
to
you
and
is
uncontroversial
and
be
sure
to
understand
just
why
your
example
exempli
fies
the
concept
memorization
has
had
a
bad
press
but
it
is
necessary
more
often
than
we
think
and
not
only
for
exams
we
do
not
encourage
memorization
for
its
own
sake
but
rather
to
make
your
passive
knowledge
more
active
the
best
time
to
memorize
is
after
you
have
become
familiar
with
a
concept
through
exposure
for
long
lists
e.g
the
prepositions
of
english
do
not
try
to
re
member
every
item
select
a
small
number
and
then
only
to
illustrate
a
con
cept
and
use
the
criteria
given
in
the
book
for
deciding
which
other
items
delahunty
and
garvey
belong
to
the
list
as
you
gain
experience
try
to
add
gradually
to
that
short
list
we
do
not
recommend
that
you
require
your
students
to
learn
lists
of
items
unless
they
are
learning
english
as
a
second
or
foreign
language
and
even
then
only
sparingly
second
opinions
aren’t
just
good
for
your
health
reading
other
authors
on
the
topics
of
these
books
will
greatly
help
you
to
learn
and
remember
what
you
study
we
encourage
you
to
seek
out
other
books
on
these
topics
begin
ning
with
those
we’ve
listed
in
the
references
and
resources
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
at
the
head
of
each
chapter
we
list
the
chapter’s
key
concepts
for
teachers
we
hope
these
will
help
you
find
topics
you
want
to
read
about
for
students
we
imagine
these
topics
serving
as
the
focus
for
essays
that
might
form
a
part
of
your
course
work
the
internal
parts
of
the
chapters
are
clearly
indicated
by
headings

for

texts
used
in
these
cur
ricula
are
based
on
various
assumptions
about
language
and
about
why
it
should
be
studied
it
is
important
that
teachers
have
a
critical
understanding
of
these
assumptions
which
in
many
instances
are
either
indirectly
stated
or
omitted
entirely
these
books
are
designed
to
help
you
to
•
develop
the
critical
resources
you
need
as
a
teacher
to
respond
to
many
language-related
issues
•
understand
the
many
concepts
needed
to
talk
appropriately
and
accurately
about
language
•
develop
skills
that
you
will
use
in
everyday
teaching
of
language
literature
reading
and
writing
in
the
pages
to
follow
you
will
encounter
ideas
about
language
that
may
be
new
to
you
and
which
may
contradict
ideas
you’ve
been
taught
we
cannot
guarantee
that
these
new
concepts
will
be
easy
to
master
but
we
do
believe
that
they
are
worth
your
best
efforts
we
will
as
we
said
earlier
try
to
begin
with
what
you
know
about
language
for
example
you
have
probably
been
taught
to
avoid
non-standard
expressions
such
as
seen
or
seed
instead
of
saw
to
avoid
multiple
nouns
as
modifiers
to
make
sure
that
your
subjects
and
verbs
agree
to
use
parallel
structures
where
possible
and
the
like
these
are
usage
rules
they
have
at
least
two
jobs
to
do
first
they
help
define
the
standard
variety
of
english—recall
our
question
in
our
introductory
chapter
that
asked
you
to
consider
why
anything
e.g
electrical
outlets
might
be
standardized
you
probably
answered
by
saying
that
standardization
allows
the
greatest
number
of
people
to
use
it
for
the
greatest
number
of
purposes
you
might
also
have
added
that
if
something
is
standardized
then
it
can
be
maintained
in
that
form
for
a
long
period
of
time
standardizing
a
language
delahunty
and
garvey
has
the
same
goals
to
allow
as
many
people
as
possible
to
communicate
ef
fectively
with
each
other
and
to
allow
people
at
any
time
to
read
texts
that
were
written
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
before
they
were
born
much
as
we
read
the
novels
of
jane
austen
now
and
standardization
allows
us
to
write
texts
that
will
be
understood
by
many
generations
to
come
the
usage
rules
help
ensure
that
standard
english
is
used
in
formal
writ
ing
and
speaking
so
as
to
make
our
writings
and
speeches
clear
efficient
and
effective
given
our
purposes
in
communicating
and
the
characteristics
of
our
audiences
rules
that
tell
us
which
forms
to
choose
saw
not
seen
or
seed
as
past
tense
of
see
or
what
syntactic
patterns
to
avoid
multiple
noun
modifiers
or
to
use
parallel
structures
are
prescriptive
ideally
they
prescribe
what
are
taken
to
be
the
most
generally
used
formal
writing
and
speaking
practices
at
a
particular
time
usage
rules
are
extremely
important
speakers
and
writers
who
violate
them
are
likely
to
be
judged
harshly
it
is
a
major
part
of
any
teacher’s
job
to
ensure
that
students
can
write
in
accordance
with
these
rules
they
can
be
found
in
composition
textbooks
which
often
devote
entire
sections
to
them
they
can
also
be
found
in
writers’
handbooks
of
usage
rules
in
usage
dictionar
ies
or
in
selected
entries
in
desk
dictionaries
unfortunately
these
handbooks
do
not
always
agree
with
each
other
and
do
not
always
keep
up
with
the
ac
cepted
writing
practices
in
important
genres
moreover
the
conventions
differ
from
one
discipline
to
another
however
for
teachers
to
be
able
to
teach
the
usage
rules
they
must
un
derstand
the
concepts
that
underlie
them
and
the
terminology
in
which
they
are
expressed
for
example
they
must
know
what
nouns
are
be
able
to
recognize
them
in
texts
and
to
produce
examples
of
them
on
demand
what
past
tense
means
and
how
it
is
formed
what
agreement
means
and
how
it
is
expressed
which
structures
are
parallel
and
which
are
not
and
what
participles
are
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
recognize
them
when
they
dangle
or
to
teach
them
in
order
to
expand
the
range
of
structures
their
students
can
use
in
their
writing
and
they
must
be
aware
of
current
usage
controversies
you
may
know
about
some
of
these
things
for
example
you
may
know
about
the
traditional
parts
of
speech
about
subjects
and
predicates
about
direct
and
indirect
objects
in
this
book
we
will
develop
all
these
and
re
lated
ideas
by
making
use
of
the
findings
of
modern
linguistic
and
discourse
studies
our
point
of
view
will
be
descriptive
rather
than
prescriptive
that
is
rather
than
prescribing
how
someone
thinks
the
language
should
be
we
will
attempt
to
describe
as
objectively
as
we
can
as
much
of
modern
stan
dard
english
as
space
allows
our
descriptive
stance
is
that
of
linguistics
in
conceptions
of
language
and
grammargeneral
which
tends
to
think
of
itself
as
scientific
we
include
a
chapter
on
usage
in
book
ii
exercise
many
people
think
of
dictionaries
as
the
final
arbiters
of
usage
issues
particularly
regarding
words
read
the
front
matter
i.e
all
the
text
before
the
list
of
words
of
your
dictionary
and
find
out
how
its
editors
view
usage
issues
then
look
up
some
words
whose
usage
is
controver
sial
such
as
hopefully
as
a
sentence
adverb
e.g
hopefully
a
solution
will
be
found
for
the
problems
in
the
middle
east
unique
as
a
gradable
adjective
e.g
his
writing
style
is
very
unique
demagogue
as
a
verb
e.g
he
demagogued
his
way
into
the
white
house
and
lifestyle
to
mean
culture
e.g
the
san
people
of
southwest
africa
enjoy
a
hunt
er/gatherer
lifestyle
how
does
your
dictionary
treat
these
controver
sies
is
the
treatment
consistent
with
the
editors’
front
matter
claims
when
was
your
dictionary
published
do
you
think
that
the
publication
date
might
have
an
effect
on
these
controversies
our
usage
chapter
explores
these
issues
in
more
detail
note
for
a
fascinating
story
about
the
oed
you
might
read

the
roles
of
the
english
teacher
standard
english
we
recognize
that
teachers
are
caught
between
apparently
irreconcilable
forces
they
must
ensure
that
their
students
master
the
forms
of
english
that
are
regarded
as
acceptable
correct
educated
and
expected
in
formal
communication
i.e
as
standard
however
educational
linguistic
research
demonstrates
that
students
will
not
learn
the
conventions
of
standard
eng
lish
unless
teachers
respect
their
native
ethnic
regional
and
social
varieties
so
how
might
this
impasse
be
resolved
first
we
must
know
what
is
and
what
is
not
currently
acceptable
sec
ond
we
must
have
a
framework
of
concepts
and
terminology
that
will
allow
us
to
understand
and
teach
about
language
third
we
should
adopt
the
be
delahunty
and
garvey
lief
that
our
only
legitimate
role
is
to
add
control
of
standard
english
to
our
students’
linguistic
repertoire
not
to
eliminate
our
students’
native
varieties
on
such
unsupportable
grounds
as
that
they
indicate
laziness
or
stupidity
they
don’t
these
books
are
designed
to
help
teachers
fulfill
these
roles
in
addition
teachers
should
make
use
of
their
students’
natural
language
learning
abilities
and
what
is
known
from
fields
such
as
linguistics
and
applied
linguistics
about
teaching
language
for
example
rather
than
overwhelming
students
by
red-lining
every
error
teachers
should
select
those
errors
which
seem
amenable
to
correction
at
the
time
and
bring
the
students’
attention
to
the
similarities
and
differences
between
their
own
practices
and
the
target
ones
they
should
then
focus
on
the
target
until
it
is
well
controlled

of

wheeler

her

linguistic
variation
and
bilingualism
all
languages
vary
that
is
there
is
no
language
whose
speakers
all
speak
in
the
same
way
in
all
circumstances
groups
of
people
may
speak
differently
from
each
other
and
still
be
speaking
the
same
language
that
is
a
language
may
exhibit
dialect
variation
a
simple
demonstration
of
this
is
to
conduct
an
informal
survey
about
the
words
people
use
for
soft
drinks
such
as
soda
pop
and
the
like
and
then
identify
where
in
the
country
the
various
expressions
are
used
languages
vary
by
nation
region
ethnicity
gender
age
and
almost
every
other
grouping
of
people
that
one
can
imagine
languages
also
vary
according
to
their
uses
an
individual
speaker
will
vary
his
or
her
style
of
speech
according
to
contextual
factors
such
as
the
formality
of
the
occasion
for
example
on
relatively
informal
occasions
we
are
likely
to
use
abbreviations
such
as
can’t
and
should’ve
in
our
speech
and
writing
on
more
formal
occasions
we
will
use
the
unabbreviated
forms
cannot
and
should
have
the
mode
or
channel
by
which
language
is
transmitted
can
affect
it
also
the
language
of
a
personal
phone
call
differs
from
that
of
a
face-to
face
con
versation
and
from
a
radio
or
tv
call-in
program
spoken
language
differs
from
written
language
though
in
rather
complex
ways
biber
et
al
occupations
may
have
their
own
special
varieties
of
a
language
that
is
they
differ
in
register
for
example
the
technical
terms
you
know
or
will
learn
about
linguistics
and
grammar
belong
to
the
linguistics
register
whereas
corner
kick
and
throw-in
belong
to
the
soccer
register
in
addition
individuals
and
groups
make
use
of
various
genres
or
text
types
these
are
extended
stretches
of
language
written
or
spoken
which
have
relatively
stable
and
identifiable
characteristics

it
refers
to

such
sub-genres
as

more
generally

include
such
cat

as

their

their

these
are
often
divided
into
descriptive

which
have

with
the

narrative

gramley

most
communities
and
many
individuals
around
the
world
are
bi
or
multi-lingual
that
is
they
make

more
than
one
language
people
in
the
united
states
make
use
of
many

some
languages
like
navajo
and
hawaiian
are
native
to
the
us
others
like
spanish
french
german
and
english
are
longtime
residents
but
were
brought
by
colonists
and
still
others
such
as
thai
and
hmong
were
brought
by
recent
immigrants
in
all
communities
some

are

denigrated
children
whose
native
language
is
not
respected
in
the
commu
nity
or
the
school
are
at
great
risk
of
failing
in
school
because
language
is
such
an
important
component
not
just
of
education
but
of
an
individual’s
personal
ethnic
and
social
identities
teachers
must
tread
a
fine
line
between
their
responsibility
to
teach
the
standard
variety
required
for
social
mobility
and
respecting
students’
native
varieties
as
manifestations
of
their
identities
just
as
every
child
has
a
right
to
expect
teachers
to
respect
their
sex
ethnicity
social
class
color
and
creed
so
every
child
has
the
right
to
expect
teachers
to
respect
their
language
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
accept
linguistic
variation
if
we
understand
it
and
understand
our
own
attitudes
toward
it
we
deal
with
this
issue
in
more
depth
in
our
chapters
on
variation
and
usage
in
book
ii
in
the
rest
of
this
chapter
we
will
consider
some
of
the
basic
ideas
about
language
that
inform
this
book
what
is
a
language
as
teachers
of
language
which
we
are
whether
we
teach
linguistics
litera
ture
esl
or
physics
we
need
to
have
a
clear
notion
of
what
it
is
that
we
teach
surprisingly
few
people
have
even
the
most
rudimentary
conception
of
what
a
language
is
even
though
they
use
at
least
one
in
nearly
every
waking
moment
of
their
lives
generally
we
can
lead
perfectly
adequate
lives
without
conceptions
based
on
serious
reflection
on
important
topics
for
instance
we
do
not
need
a
precise
understanding
of
physical
notions
such
delahunty
and
garvey
as
force
work
or
energy
to
hit
home
runs
or
drive
cars
but
education
aims
to
help
us
understand
things
that
we
take
for
granted
language
is
a
prime
example
it
is
a
device
of
mind-boggling
complexity
but
few
people
have
a
clear
conception
of
its
nature
and
use
so
what
is
a
language
what
we
have
in
mind
here
is
a
natural
i.e
not
an
artificial
or
computer-based
system
for
human
communication
such
as
english
chinese
swahili
or
american
sign
language
asl
in
this
book
we’ll
assume
that
a
language
is
a
set
of
rules
unconsciously
present
in
the
mind
which
enables
human
beings
to
represent
and
communicate
meanings
by
producing
audible
visible
or
tactile
symbols
that
these
rules
system
atically
relate
to
those
meanings
this
definition
may
seem
forbidding
and
abstract
so
let’s
look
at
it
piece
by
piece
a
language
enables
its
users
to
communicate
meanings
by
systematically
relating
perceptible
actions
and
meanings
meanings
are
mental
states
or
activities
and
as
such
cannot
be
directly
ob
served
if
we
want
to
communicate
our
meanings
to
someone
else
we
must
use
something
they
can
perceive
with
their
senses—for
example
noises
gestures
flag
waving
or
marks
on
paper
for
any
of
these
to
communicate
successfully
there
must
be
a
system
that
consistently
relates
the
observable
signals
with
the
private
meanings
for
lots
of
good
reasons
sound
evolved
as
the
primary
mode
of
human
communication
this
issue
is
discussed
in
the
next
section
most
people
conceive
of
meaning
in
terms
of
information
ideas
about
the
external
world
or
about
our
thoughts
and
beliefs
this
is
called
referential
experiential
ideational
meaning
referential
meanings
rep
resent
events
such
as
the
us
women’s
soccer
team
won
the
world
cup
or
states
such
as
the
sun
is
a
small
star
they
are
descriptions
of
states
of
affairs
real
or
imagined
referential
meaning
is
probably
the
most
com
monly
communicated
type
of
meaning
however
there
are
other
kinds
•
expressive
meaning
reflects
the
emotional
state
of
a
speaker
ouch
has
no
referential
status
but
expresses
pain
•
persuasive
conative
meaning
refers
to
the
intended
effect
of
an
utterance
on
its
hearer
it
attempts
to
get
an
audience
to
per
form
an
action
or
to
believe
something
get
out
is
an
attempt
to
get
conceptions
of
language
and
grammarsomeone
to
leave
i
love
you
honest
i
really
do
is
an
attempt
to
get
someone
to
believe
that
i
loves
them
•
social
phatic
interpersonal
meaning
as
in
expressions
such
as
hi
and
how
are
you
establishes
and
maintains
social
contact
be
tween
communicators
•
t
extual
meaning
is
communicated
by
utterances
that
constitute
part
of
a
text
e.g
the
dogs
were
very
noisy
the
german
shep
herds
were
the
worst
without
very
noisy
in
the
first
of
these
two
sentences
it
would
be
impossible
to
interpret
the
worst
as
noisiest
this
meaning
derives
from
the
assumption
that
the
two
sentences
are
to
be
interpreted
as
a
text
that
is
one
or
more
sentences
or
utterances
intended
to
be
taken
as
a
coherent
whole
some
expres
sions
have
only
textual
meanings
for
example
in
some
of
its
uses
so
indicates
that
the
expression
it
introduces
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
conclusion
drawn
from
a
prior
expression
or
from
the
context
the
retort
so
what
is
a
demand
to
know
what
conclusion
to
draw
from
what
a
speaker
has
just
said
•
metalinguistic
meaning
addresses
matters
concerning
the
lan
guage
itself
definitions
and
word
puzzles
are
metalinguistic
e.g
what
i
meant
to
say
was
or
what
english
word
has
three
double
letters
in
a
row
see

end
of

•
poetic
meaning
reflects
nuances
of
interpretation
created
by
the
manner
in
which
information
is
expressed
it
is
the
aesthetic
dimen
sion

in

that
sound
is
the
primary
mode
of
linguistic
expression
we
mean
that
it
is
the
principal
earliest
and
most
fundamental
mode
literate
people
who
are
not
linguists
tend
to
assume
that
writing
is
the
most
important
form
of
language
in
fact
they
tend
to
assume
that
the
spoken
language
should
be
modeled
on
its
written
form
for
example
many
people
will
use
a
word’s
spelling
to
resolve
a
dispute
over
its
pronunciation
and
the
pronun
ciation
of
some
words
has
changed
to
be
more
consistent
with
their
spell
ings
for
instance
often
has
historically
been
pronounced
offen
however
many
people
nowadays
think
that
because
it
is
written
with
the
letter
t
it
should
be
pronounced
with
a
t
sound
linguists
in
general
believe
that
sound
is
the
primary
medium
of
lan
guage
because
it
precedes
writing
in
evolutionary
and
individual
develop
ment
because
letters
represent
sounds
not
vice
versa
and
because
we
use
spoken
language
more
frequently
in
our
lives
so
it
is
arguably
more
im
portant
to
us
to
support
their
claim
linguists
point
out
facts
such
as
the
following
•
children
learn
to
talk
before
they
learn
to
read
and
write
•
children
learn
to
talk
naturally
that
is
without
being
expressly
taught
reading
and
writing
must
be
taught
•
there
are
many
languages
that
have
no
writing
systems
•
writing
is
a
comparatively
recent
historical
development
it
has
been
around
for
only
a
few
thousand
years
spoken
language
is
at
conceptions
of

all
writing
systems
are
attempts
to
represent
aspects
of

generally
individual
consonants
and

less

still
words
we
do
not
deny
the
importance
of

modes
of

written
language
is
extremely
important
in
modern
societies
and
we
all
spend
many
years
mastering
it
the
sounds
speakers
produce
and
which
are
partially
processed
by
hearers’
ears
fade
away
very
rapidly
writing
attempts
to
over
come
this
rapid
fading
there
is
always
a
dynamic
relation
between
spoken
and
written
language
each
influences
the
other
to
various
degrees
for
example
currently
we
tend
to
allow
more
speech-like
forms
into
our
writing
than
our
grandparents
did
e.g
contractions
such
as
can’t
i’ve
and
she’s
sign
languages
of
the
deaf
which
use
the
hands
to
express
meanings
are
another
important
language
type
but
while
they
can
express
whatever
a
signer
wishes
to
communicate
just
as
a
spoken
language
can
they
are
a
relatively
uncommon
form
of
language
if
we
group
together
sounds
written
symbols
and
manual
gestures
as
lin
guistic
forms
then
we
can
think
of
a
language
as
a
system
for
relating
forms
to
meanings
exercise
find
and
discuss
three
differences
between
spoken
and
written
eng
lish
or
any
other
language
that
you
are
familiar
with
for
example
you
might
consider
tone
of
voice
what
advantages
or
disadvantages
do
you
think
spoken
language
has
over
other
forms
of
communication
such
as
written
language
manual
language
waving
flags
scratching
signs
in
dirt
or
rocks
etc
think
both
in
terms
of
our
distant
ancestors
and
of
practical
contemporary
needs
as
a
concrete
example
you
might
consider
how
to
explain
without
speaking
or
writing
how
to
bake
bread
wash
a
car
upgrade
a
computer
or
use
a
phone
keypad
to
respond
to
commands
from
a
com
pany’s
computerized
answering
system
consult
actual
texts
such
as
recipe
books
labels
on
bottles
or
users’
manuals
refer
to
your
per
sonal
experience
wherever
possible
you
might
also
look
at
software
that
turns
speech
into
typed
text
e.g
dragon
naturally
speaking
delahunty
and
garvey
the
relation
between
meaning
and
sound
is
conventional
and
arbitrary
according
to
ferdinand
de
saussure
and
accepted
by
the
vast
majority
of
linguists
the
relation
between
a
word’s
sound
and
its
meaning
is
conventional
that
is
the
speakers
of
a
language
tacitly
agree
on
which
mean
ings
to
associate
with
which
sounds
for
example
the
fruit
we
make
apple
jelly
from
is
called
apple
in
english
pomme
in
french
manzana
in
spanish
úll
in
irish
and
other
names
in
other
languages
this
conventional
relationship
is
arbitrary
that
is
speakers
of
a
language
as
a
group
are
free
to
associate
any
sounds
with
any
meaning
it
doesn’t
mat
ter
which
sounds
they
associate
with
which
meanings
thus
the
sound
of
the
word
i
is
arbitrarily
though
not
randomly
i.e
without
purpose
chosen
by
english
speakers
to
represent
the
speaker
of
an
utterance
we
could
equally
designate
the
speaker
by
the
sounds
je
as
in
french
or
yo
as
in
spanish
or
ich
as
in
german
or
wo
as
in
chinese
or
any
other
sound(s
we
agreed
on
from
the
claim
that
sound
meaning
relationships
are
both
conventional
and
arbitrary
it
follows
that
there
need
not
be
any
similarity
between
sound
and
what
it
refers
to
the
word
pigeon
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
birds
it
refers
to
similarly
the
words
yell
and
whisper
can
be
said
either
loudly
or
softly
even
though
they
refer
to
loud
and
soft
sounds
giant
and
dwarf
have
the
same
number
of
sounds
despite
the
different
sizes
of
the
things
they
refer
to
lilliputian
is
a
big
word
meaning
small
but
big
is
a
small
word
meaning
large
finally
there
is
no
natural
or
causal
connection
between
words
and
their
meanings
that
is
words
and
their
meanings
are
not
connected
in
the
way
that
smoke
and
fire
or
explosions
and
noise
or
cars
and
air
pollution
are
we
know
that
fires
cause
smoke
and
so
when
we
see
smoke
we
can
assume
that
there
is
also
fire
the
particular
sounds
of
a
word
do
not
cause
its
meanings
in
this
way
nor
do
the
meanings
cause
the
choice
of
word
sounds
however
all
languages
have
some
expressions
that
are
non
arbitrary
they
are
said
to
be
motivated
by
some
factor
other
than
convention
one
mo
tivation
is
similarity
between
the
word
sounds
and
sounds
associated
with
the
things
the
words
refer
to
common
examples
of
these
are
onomatopoeic
words
for
animal
noises
e.g
moo
bow-wow
and
quack-quack
note
that
the
last
two
of
these
suggest
that
dogs
and
ducks
normally
make
noises
in
pairs
and
that
english
speakers
can
distinguish
a
dog’s
bow
from
its
wow
note
however
that
an
irish
dog
goes
amh-amh
and
a
serbo-croatian
one
goes
av
av
this
suggests
that
onomatopoeic
words
are
not
perfect
imitations
at
least
some
conventionality
is
at
work
in
them
to
appreciate
the
range
of
ways
in
which
languages
represent
animal
sounds
go
to
http://www.eleceng.adelaide
conceptions
of
language
and
grammaredu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html
another
type
of
motivation
is
sound
symbolism
the
relatively
consistent
association
of
certain
sounds
with
certain
meanings
for
example
the
ee
vowel
sounds
of
teeny
suggests
something
small
we
find
similar
uses
of
similar
vowels
in
other
languages
spanish
for
example
uses
the
suffix
ito/a
to
desig
nate
small
things
and
children
however
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
vowel
always
carries
this
diminutive
meaning
for
example
no
hint
of
smallness
appears
in
words
like
beefy
treaty
keep
or
heal
and
similarities
with
other
languages
may
be
purely
accidental
chen
is
a
diminutive
suffix
of
german
a
language
more
closely
related
to
english
than
spanish
is
while
it
is
true
that
the
vast
majority
of
words
that
consist
of
just
a
single
meaningful
part
e.g
lamp
and
post
are
arbitrarily
related
to
their
meanings
combinations
of
such
words
frequently
are
not
that
lamppost
means
lamp
post
is
motivated
by
the
fact
that
it
consists
of
lamp
and
post
exercise
what
apparent
motivation
occurs
in
the
following
english
words
what
words
can
you
think
of
that
don’t
fit
the
patterns
a
slop
slime
slush
b
itsy-bitsy
tinkle
twinkle
c
slip
slink
slide
slither
d
moo
meow
cuckoo
duality
of
patterning
this
strange
phrase
means
that
meaningful
linguistic
units
such
as
words
are
composed
of
discrete
units
that
have
no
meaning
for
example
the
word
book
clearly
has
a
meaning
but
just
as
clearly
each
of
its
individual
sounds
b
oo
and
k
has
no
meaning
individual
sounds
like
these
can
be
used
to
create
other
words
so
languages
take
one
or
a
combination
of
meaning
less
sounds
and
then
assign
meanings
to
them
the
expressions
of
non
human
animals
even
those
with
relatively
large
numbers
of
expressions
seem
not
to
be
designed
like
this
with
the
result
that
their
call
repertoires
cannot
be
readily
expanded
displacement
human
language
allows
human
beings
to
talk
about
anything
regardless
of
whether
what
they
talk
about
is
in
the
immediate
context
occurred
in
the
past
will
occur
in
the
future
or
indeed
did
not
may
not
or
will
not
ever
oc
cur
this
freedom
from
the
here
and
now
is
called
displacement
non-human
delahunty
and
garvey
communication
is
typically
tied
to
the
time
and
place
at
which
it
occurs
as
a
result
we
are
far
better
liars
than
other
animals
a
language
is
distinctively
human
this
is
a
remarkably
controversial
topic
when
we
speak
of
language
in
this
book
what
we
have
in
mind
are
systems
such
as
english
french
swahili
or
navajo
however
the
word
language
is
often
used
loosely
to
indicate
any
means
of
conveying
meaning—e.g
the
language
of
dance
the
language
of
flowers
animal
languages
the
discipline
of
semiotics
developed
to
study
the
language-like
characteristics
of
various
forms
of
communication
the
range
of
semiotic
meaningful
systems
is
great
encompassing
natural
languages
ges
tures
spatial
relations
animal
communication
film
advertising
logos
traffic
signals
clothing
and
many
other
modes
of
communication
much
semiotic
research
draws
on
linguistic
concepts
semiotic
and
other
linguistic
studies
have
demonstrated
the
richness
of
human
communication
but
have
never
uncovered
any
means
of
communi
cation
superior
to
human
language
in
the
complexity
range
or
precision
of
its
meanings
this
is
not
surprising
one
could
hardly
imagine
translating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
into
body
language
or
the
language
of
cloth
ing
while
semiotics
has
dramatically
enlarged
our
awareness
of
the
scope
of
meaningful
systems
it
has
produced
no
challengers
to
language
either
on
quantitative
or
qualitative
grounds
likewise
research
into
animal
communication
has
vastly
improved
our
ap
preciation
of
the
natural
communication
systems
of
primates
dolphins
birds
and
frogs
but
it
has
presented
no
rivals
to
human
communication
again
ei
ther
on
qualitative
or
quantitative
grounds
a
few
primates
have
learned
usu
ally
with
intensive
training
to
communicate
in
language-like
ways
through
manual
signs
plastic
symbols
or
computers
their
success
tells
us
a
good
deal
about
their
intelligence
especially
of
bonobo
chimps
but
their
communica
tive
systems
are
not
equivalent
to
english
or
any
other
human
language
for
some
people
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
humans
have
language
and
animals
don’t
according
to
many
religions
language
was
given
to
humans

for
others
this
topic
is
intensely
controversial
some
claim
that
our
closest
animal
relatives
share
some
of
our
linguistic
capacities
others
insist
that
there
is
no
continuity
between
whatever
cognition
and
communication
other
primates
are
capable
of
and
human
language
the
following
items

give

we
must
add
here
that
all
normal
human
beings
can
be
both
producers
and
receivers
of
human
language
a
characteristic
known
as
reciprocity
or
interchangeability
in
many
animal
communication
systems
one
sex
usu
ally
the
male
produces
signals
while
the
other
merely
receives
them
another
perspective
on
this
issue
is
the
relationship
between
intelligence
and
language
assuming
controversially
that
iq
provides
a
reliable
index
of
intelligence
lenneberg
claimed
that
language
abilities
are
not
significantly
absent
even
at
dramatically
low
levels
though
he
may
have
overstated
the
case
jackendoff
n
children
whose
i.q
is
at
age
and
about
at
age
are
com
pletely
in
possession
of
language
though
their
articulation
may
be
poor
and
an
occasional
grammatical
mistake
may
occur
lenneberg
a
language
is
culturally
transmitted
no
child
comes
into
the
world
capable
of
learning
only
a
specific
language
or
set
of
languages
all
normal
children
can
learn
any
human
language
all
they
need
is
appropriate
learning
situations
languages
are
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
the
next
by
cultural
transmission
not
by
genetic
trans
mission
as
is
the
case
with
many
animal
communication
systems
having
said
that
we
must
add
that
without
the
physiological
and
neu
rological
bases
that
language
depends
on
children
would
be
unable
to
learn
any
language
so
learning
a
language
depends
upon
having
both
the
right
biological
bases
and
the
right
learning
environment
knowledge
of
a
language
is
unconsciously
present
in
the
mind
consider
the
following
questions
a
do
you
like
duckling
b
do
you
like
snorkeling
c
do
you
like
kipling
without
the
slightest
bit
of
thought
you
know
which
one
of
these
ques
tions
can
be
answered
yes
i
like
to
you
know
that
snorkel
but
not
duckle
or
kiple
can
occur
after
i
like
to
you
can
tell
all
of
this
without
any
knowledge
of
grammatical
analysis
such
as
that
snorkel
is
a
verb
and
though
you
may
not
know
terms
such
as
morpheme
and
di
delahunty
and
garvey
minutive
ling
in
a
you
know
that
duckling
and
snorkeling
have
two
meaningful
parts
but
that
kipling
has
only
one
you
also
know
the
gram
matical
form
and
function
of
snorkeling
in
b
though
you
might
not
be
able
to
provide
a
technical
description
see
our
chapters
on
phrases
basic
clause
patterns
and
multi
clause
sentences
knowing
a
language
then
is
not
the
same
as
knowing
terminology
or
being
able
to
articulate
gram
matical
descriptions
your
knowledge
of
language
is
unconscious
knowl
edge
no
amount
of
introspection
meditation
psychotherapy
or
brain
surgery
will
allow
you
to
access
it
directly
the
clearest
sign
of
unconscious
knowledge
is
the
presence
of
linguistic
intuitions
gut
feelings
about
language
that
we
could
not
have
without
un
conscious
linguistic
knowledge
these
intuitions
are
not
the
product
of
educa
tion
totally
illiterate
people
have
them
they
derive
from
genetic
capacities
specific
to
humans
and
from
having
acquired
a
language
one’s
unconscious
knowledge
of
language
is
called
linguistic
competence
we
will
have
more
to
say
about
linguistic
competence
below
a
language
consists
of
rules
unfortunately
the
word
rule
conjures
up
exactly
the
wrong
image
of
lin
guistic
knowledge
suggesting
the
prescriptions
of
right
and
wrong
that
we
find
in
handbooks
linguists
however
use
the
word
to
mean
two
related
ideas
first
a
rule
is
a
part
of
our
unconscious
knowledge
of
our
language
our
linguistic
competence
it
is
a
mental
pattern
about
a
limited
part
of
a
language
e.g
pronunciation
sentence
structure
or
what
a
word
means
for
instance
english
has
a
basic
subject
verb
object
word
order

verbwrote
objectsome
fine
poetry
when
we
produce
sentences
of
this
sort
we
are
acting
as
if
we
were
following
a
rule
that
says
put
subjects
before
verbs
and
verbs
before
objects
if
we
were
not
following
rules
our
speech
would
be
chaotic
and
unintelligible
not
the
highly
patterned
communicative
activity
it
is
second
linguists
also
use
the
word
rule
to
refer
to
their
attempts
to
for
mulate
these
linguistic
patterns
in
words
that
is
to
the
model
we
build
of
an
unconscious
mental
rule
our
model
is
not
the
rule
itself
which
remains
forever
inaccessible
conceptions
of
language
and
grammarexercise
what
rule
would
you
formulate
that
would
allow
english
speakers
to
say
that
sentences
a
b
and
c
are
ok
but
that
d
is
not
the
symbol
means
ungrammatical
i.e
not
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
compe
tence
feel
free
to
make
use
of
grammatical
terminology
and
also
of
terms
for
meanings
a
john

the
address
up
b
john
looked
it
up
c
john
looked
up
the
address
d
john
looked
up
it
and
what
rule
would
you
formulate
to
explain
why
a-c
below
are
grammatical
but
d
is
not
a
harry

d
harry
sent
boston
a
package
can
you
think
of
a
context
or
a
meaning
in
which
this
sentence
can
be
grammatical
a
language
is
a
system
rules
are
not
distributed
randomly
in
the
mind
like
potatoes
in
a
sack
rather
they
are
systematically
related
to
one
another
it
is
easiest
to
envision
this
con
ception
with
an
analogy
a
computer
system
has
a
set
of
components
central
processing
unit
monitor
keyboard
speakers
drives
of
various
types
whose
overall
function
is
to
process
information
the
components
interact
with
each
other
you
can
for
instance
play
a
cd
while
reading
your
email
the
com
ponents
also
contain
smaller
parts
all
of
which
interact
in
precise
though
limited
ways
with
each
other
and
with
parts
of
other
components
language
systems
likewise
have
components
the
most
commonly
cited
ones
are
•
phonetics
phonology
•
morphology
•
vocabulary
•
orthography/spelling/writing
•
syntax
•
semantics
•
pragmatics
•
discourse
delahunty
and
garvey
phonetics
and
phonology
are
concerned
with
the
sounds
of
language
mor
phology
with
the
structure
of
words
vocabulary
with
our
store
of
words
orthography
with
the
spelling
system
syntax
with
the
principles
of
sentence
structure
semantics
with
the
literal
meanings
of
words
and
sentences
prag
matics
with
the
meanings
that
arise
when
expressions
are
used
in
specific
contexts
and
discourse
with
the
linguistic
and
rhetorical
patterns
in
texts
of
various
kinds
as
we
proceed
you
will
learn
the
intricate
ways
in
which
the
system
operates
for
the
moment
let
us
look
at
one
concrete
example
of
how
the
system
creates
interdependencies
among
its
rules
and
components
the
syntactic
rule
for
yes/no
questions
is
connected
to
the
rules
of
pronunciation
specifically
the
rules
for
intonation
the
musical
pattern
of
speech
listen
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
your
voice
as
you
say
a
as
a
statement
of
fact
and
b
as
a
question
a
they’re
leaving
at
b
they’re
leaving
at
the
order
of
words
stays
the
same
but
the
intonation
pattern
indicates
whether
the
sentence
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
statement
or
as
a
question
in
this
book
we
will
begin
our
discussion
with
a
skeletal
overview
of
english
grammar
beginning
with
the
largest
grammatical
units
sentences
and
working
down
to
the
smallest
sounds
and
letters
this
is
the
opposite
of
our
presentation
of
the
grammar
in
the
following
chapters
there
we
be
gin
with
the
smallest
units
and
work
our
way
up
to
the
largest
we
hope
that
by
spiraling
in
this
way
readers
who
have
no
background
in
language
study
will
get
an
initial
orientation
and
those
who
have
had
some
background
will
get
a
quick
refresher
before
venturing
into
greater
depth
competence
and
performance
as
we
mentioned
modern
linguists
distinguish
between
the
knowledge
that
speakers
of
a
language
must
have
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
that
language
and
the
actual
use
they
make
of
that
knowledge
to
speak
understand
read
or
write
linguists
call
our
unconscious
knowledge
of
the
rules
that
constitute
the
language
competence
and
our
linguistic
activities
that
make
use
of
that
knowledge
performance
performance
provides
ample
evidence
of
competence
we
can
use
our
abil
ity
to
specify
what
is
and
what
is
not
grammatical
i.e
consistent
with
the
unconscious
rules
of
our
language
consider
the
following
the
blocking
the
entrance
protester
was
arrested
conceptions
of
language
and
grammarthough
we
can
certainly
make
sense
of
the
sentence
we
know
that
it
isn’t
natural
english
the
german
translation
would
be
grammatical
with
this
word
order
of
course
we
may
not
be
able
to
articulate
exactly
what
makes
the
sentence
unnatural
nor
is
it
likely
that
we
have
been
taught
anything
ex
plicitly
about
sentences
like
this
likewise
you
can
determine
hidden
grammatical
relations
that
is
im
plicit
subjects
objects
and
the
like
a
joan
is
eager
to
please
b
joan
is
easy
to
please
in
a
joan
will
do
the
pleasing
in
b
someone
else
will
please
joan
such
understood
relations
are
very
common
in
language
finally
you
can
also
perceive
ambiguity
two
or
more
distinct
interpreta
tions
molly
told
angela
about
herself
here
molly
is
talking
either
about
molly
or
about
angela
exercise
advertisers
often
make
use
of
ambiguity
for
example
ge’s
we
bring
good
things
to
life
find
other
examples
of
ambiguity
in
advertis
ing
express
their
ambiguous
meanings
in
non-ambiguous
sentences
why
do
you
think
advertisers
might
like
ambiguity
how
about
poets
you
might
mull
over
the
last
line
of
dylan
thomas’
poem
a
refusal
to
mourn
the
death
by
fire
of
a
child
in
london
after
the
first
death
there
is
no
other
the
idea
of
competence
depends
on
certain
idealizations
many
linguists
though
by
no
means
all
assume
that
all
speakers
of
a
language
have
the
same
set
of
rules
in
their
competence
this
is
a
deliberate
simplification
made
with
full
awareness
of
the
variety
inherent
in
natural
language
it
is
done
to
allow
linguists
to
develop
models
of
competence
without
being
distracted
by
phenomena
that
do
not
appear
to
affect
the
model’s
basic
principles
this
assumption
is
not
uncontroversial
it
has
been
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
ignore
the
social
discourse
and
textual
functions
of
language
which
some
linguists
believe
to
be
crucial
in
understanding
language
structure
it
delahunty
and
garvey
has
also
been
viewed
because
the
majority
of
linguists
are
white
male
and
middle
class
as
a
thinly
disguised
attempt
to
define
their
variety
of
english
as
the
basis
for
the
grammatical
theory
for
all
languages
and
all
varieties
much
as
latin
grammar
was
until
recently
and
in
many
situations
still
is
the
model
for
the
grammars
of
many
european
languages
while
neither
criticism
is
justified
in
its
extreme
version
both
point
to
limitations
of
the
language-as
competence
approach
they
also
point
to
the
need
to
understand
language
as
a
social
artifact
used
by
social
beings
in
social
contexts
for
social
purposes
we
deal
with
such
considerations
in
our
chapters
on
variation
and
usage
in
book
ii
a
language
is
acquired
because
many
modern
theoretical
linguists
begin
from
the
assumption
that
what
they
are
modeling
is
knowledge
it
follows
that
their
theories
have
implications
for
psychology
and
ultimately
for
biology
many
believe
that
language
is
a
very
specialized
perhaps
unique
kind
of
knowledge
they
believe
that
an
individual’s
primary
form
of
language
is
not
acquired
in
the
ways
that
other
kinds
of
knowledge
are
acquired
such
as
writing
or
arithme
tic
in
support
of
this
belief
they
point
out
that
children
learn
the
language
or
languages
of
their
environments
without
any
instruction
or
correction
from
parents
or
peers
all
they
need
to
acquire
language
is
someone
to
com
municate
with
them
moreover
they
learn
a
vastly
complex
system
in
a
very
short
time
and
all
create
very
similar
grammars
of
a
given
language
regard
less
of
the
differences
in
what
they
hear
about
them
and
up
to
a
point
regardless
of
their
differences
in
intelligence
most
tellingly
linguists
point
out
that
when
we
know
a
language
we
know
far
more
than
we
could
have
gleaned
just
from
the
language
we
heard
around
us
our
linguistic
competence
is
far
richer
in
its
depth
variety
and
intricacy
smith
than
the
evidence
that
we
used
to
acquire
our
languages
for
example
english
speakers
know
that
sentences
like
a
are
ungrammatical
while
b
is
fine
a
she
sang
beautifully
the
song
b
she
sang
the
song
beautifully
no
child
learning
english
as
opposed
to
french
or
italian
as
their
native
lan
guage
has
to
be
taught
indeed
no
child
can
be
taught
that
sentences
such
as
a
are
ungrammatical
how
would
you
articulate
the
rule
that
a
violates
and
then
explain
it
to
a
child
the
idea
that
we
know
more
than
we
have
evidence
for
is
called
the
poverty
of
the
stimulus
argument
the
difference
conceptions
of
language
and
grammarbetween
what
we
know
and
what
we
have
linguistic
evidence
for
must
have
come
from
somewhere
it
can
only
have
come
from
cognitive
and
brain
struc
tures
specialized
for
language
acquisition
the
linguists
who
are
persuaded
by
arguments
like
these
hold
that
human
beings
do
not
enter
the
world
as
blank
slates
rather
they
bring
with
them
innate
ideas
that
guide
them
in
acquiring
their
language(s
on
the
basis
of
these
observations
and
the
similarities
between
languages
many
linguists
argue
that
human
beings
are
genetically
endowed
with
a
capac
ity
to
acquire
languages
with
particular
kinds
of
rule
systems
they
argue
that
linguistic
knowledge
is
of
a
different
type
than
other
knowledge
because
it
is
based
on
specialized
cognitive
structures
which
in
turn
appear
to
be
based
on
specialized
brain
structures
in
support
of
this
neurobiological
claim
linguists
point
out
that
first
lan
guage
learning
must
be
accomplished
within
a
critical
period
in
a
person’s
life
before
the
teenage
years
if
it
is
to
be
successful
moreover
damage
to
cer
tain
parts
of
the
brain
mainly
in
the
left
hemisphere
affects
people’s
linguistic
abilities
whereas
damage
to
corresponding
areas
in
the
right
hemisphere
need
not
thus
the
language
capacity
appears
to
be
at
least
partially
localized
in
the
left
side
of
the
brain
if
this
point
of
view
is
correct
it
explains
why
even
with
intense
and
specific
training
no
non-humans
even
the
most
intelligent
ones
have
ever
learned
a
human
language
in
contrast
we
must
be
taught
how
to
write
though
we
may
begin
learn
ing
it
at
any
age—but
generally
only
after
we
have
already
learned
a
primary
form
of
language
exercise
what
kinds
of
errors
have
you
observed
people
make
as
they
learn
a
second
language
or
children
as
they
learn
their
first
language
find
a
description
of
one
of
the
many
attempts
to
teach
an
ape
a
human
language
describe
the
teaching
methods
and
the
results
how
do
they
compare
to
the
ways
in
which
children
acquire
languages
how
do
these
animals’
linguistic
skills
compare
with
the
linguistic
skills
of
ordinary
people
a
language
is
infinite
our
view
of
language
and
grammar
makes
some
very
important
claims
about
the
nature
of
knowledge
at
least
of
linguistic
knowledge
it
used
to
be
thought
delahunty
and
garvey
that
all
knowledge
whether
acquired
by
a
human
or
a
bird
was
essentially
a
matter
of
habit
one
learned
to
respond
in
specific
ways
to
particular
events
and
the
strength
of
the
habit
was
a
function
of
the
number
of
times
a
particu
lar
stimulus
and
response
were
associated
by
the
learner
from
this
point
of
view
understanding
a
sentence
would
be
a
matter
of
associating
a
particular
response
with
it
and
learning
a
language
would
be
a
matter
of
learning
just
which
responses
go
with
which
sentences
the
process
was
viewed
by
behav
iorist
psychologists
as
in
principle
identical
to
the
process
by
which
a
labora
tory
pigeon
learns
to
peck
at
different
colors
or
shapes
in
noam
chomsky
published
a
remarkable
little
book
syntactic
structures
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
behaviorist
approach
to
language
cannot
in
principle
account
for
language
its
acquisition
or
its
use
this
is
because
language
is
vast
in
fact
the
number
of
sentences
in
any
language
is
infinite
so
no
theory
that
assumes
that
language
learning
is
habit-formation
can
in
principle
explain
it
you
can
demonstrate
the
vastness
of
language
for
yourself
in
a
number
of
ways
select
what
you
believe
to
be
the
longest
sentence
of
the
language
once
you
have
your
candidate
put
the
words
i
believe
that
before
it
now
you
have
created
a
sentence
even
longer
than
the
first
this
must
now
be
the
longest
sentence
of
the
language
but
even
to
this
we
can
add
fred
thinks
that
to
cre
ate
an
even
longer
sentence
to
make
an
infinitely
long
story
short
there
is
no
longest
sentence
in
english
or
any
other
natural
language
although
recent
reports
on
the
amazonian
language
pirahã
call
this
into
question
colapinto
language
allows
us
in
principle
if
not
in
actu
ality
to
create
infinitely
long
sentences
and
consequently
to
create
an
infinite
number
of
sentences
we
do
this
by
inserting
one
sentence
within
another
within
another
within
another
ad
infinitum
this
property
of
inserting
a
sentence
within
a
sentence
is
called
recursion
it
is
because
natural
lan
guages
are
recursive
that
they
allow
for
the
creation
of
an
infinite
number
of
sentences
all
natural
human
languages
have
this
property
so
do
all
varieties
and
dialects
of
all
human
languages
it
follows
that
all
languages
and
varieties
are
equal
from
a
linguist’s
point
of
view
the
creativity
of
language
is
based
on
its
recursiveness
exercise
can
you
think
of
a
different
set
of
sentences
that
demonstrates
the
in
finity
of
language
for
example
start
with
the

book
that
i
read

of
language
and

now
while
our
sentences
may
be
infinite
our
memories
are
not
con
sequently
our
knowledge
of
our
language
our
competence
cannot
be
just
a
set
of
sentences
it
must
be
a
finite
set
of
devices
that
allow
us
to
create
or
understand
sentences
as
we
need
to
thus
we
can
produce
and
under
stand
an
indefinite
number
of
sentences
that
we
have
never
heard
or
uttered
before
we
do
this
partially
by
matching
what
we
hear
with
the
rules
of

that
we
keep
in
our
heads

prescriptive
and

prescriptive
grammarians
are
mainly
concerned
with
the
conventions
that
govern
formal
written
communication
their
goal
is
to
maintain
a
stan
dardized
variety
of
a
language
so
that
it
can
function
as
the
variety
used
for
communication
by
the
major
domains
of
a
state
such
as
education
government
commerce
and
law
as
well
as
among
people
separated
by
great
distances
by
great
cultural
differences
and
by
considerable
spans
of
time
this
requires
a
set
of
widely
accepted
conventions
that
are
codified
in
grammars
dictionaries
and
style
manuals
these
conventions
are
designed
with
the
goal
of
ensuring
that
people
using
the
standard
variety
will
use
the
same
forms
in
the
same
ways
and
with
the

prescriptive
grammar
in
more
detail
descriptive
linguists
are
primarily
interested
in
people’s
actual
linguistic
knowledge
and
behavior—in
what
they
say
and
how
they
say
it—regardless
of
whether
it
conforms
to
the
standard
prescriptions
they
do
not
judge
it
to
be
correct
or
incorrect
generally
they
believe
that
if
a
community
of
native
speakers
of
a
language
consistently
speaks
or
writes
in
such
and
such
a
way
then
so
be
it
that
for
the
descriptive
linguist
is
correct
regardless
of
how
prescriptive
grammarians
view
the
behavior
descriptive
linguists
attempt
to
put
aside
their
own
linguistic
prejudices
yes
we
all
have
them
and
accept
and
describe
what
they
observe
exercise
using
a
usage
or
style
manual
find
three
expressions
e.g
we
was
that
english
speakers
frequently
use
but
which
the
manual
claims
we
shouldn’t
what
if
any
reasons
does
the
manual
give
for
preferring
one
expression
over
others
how
valid
do
you
think
the
reasons
are
to
make
the
differences
between
these
two
approaches
more
concrete
let’s
consider
an
example
consider
who
and
whom
handbooks
claim
that
who
and
whom
should
be
used
as
illustrated
in
a-c
a
who
phoned
b
to
whom
did
you
speak
c
whom
did
you
speak
to
however
in
ordinary
conversation
we
are
unlikely
to
use
whom
in
sentences
like
c
and
far
more
likely
to
use
who
d
who
did
you
speak
to
descriptive
linguists
comparing
c
with
d
would
note
the
different
forms
and
that
c
with
whom
is
used
in
very
formal
contexts
whereas
d
with
who
is
used
in
less
formal
ones
see
baron
they
would
also
note
that
the
to
associated
with
who(m
is
to
its
left
in
b
but
not
in
c
or
d
from
this
they
would
infer
that
to
stays
to
the
left
of
who(m
in
formal
con
texts
and
in
those
circumstances
whom
is
required

descriptive
viewpoints
theoretical
analytic
and
applied
the
descriptive
approach
to
language
encompasses
a
much
wider
range
of
inquiry
than
just
grammar
in
the
following
sections
we
sketch
the
spectrum
of
interests
that
descriptive
linguists
have
pursued
in
so
doing
we
hope
to
stimulate
your
curiosity
about
topics
that
will
one
day
inform
your
own
teaching
theoretical
linguistics
theoretical
linguists
take
a
descriptive
attitude
but
they
want
to
go
beyond
merely
describing
language
their
goals
are
to
understand
what
they
observe
and
to
explain
why
human
languages
are
as
they
are
to
do
this
they
construct
models
or
theories
of
language
models
are
portrayals
verbal
and
visual
of
the
design
of
languages
for
instance
a
model
might
sketch
out
a
syntactic
component
that
includes
several
different
types
of
rules
as
we’ll
see
in
our
chapter
on
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
in
so
doing
theoretical
linguists
try
to
formulate
general
statements
about
what
is
possible
and
what
is
not
possible
in
the
syntax
of
human
languages
for
example
a
theoretical
linguist
might
try
to
determine
why
no
human
language
asks
questions
by
simply
reversing
the
word
order
of
statements
theoretical
linguists
thus
can
identify
some
very
general
principles
that
govern
language
in
science
as
in
many
other
fields
if
a
statement
follows
log
ically
from
general
principles
then
it
is
regarded
as
explained
in
linguistics
if
the
rules
proposed
for
a
language
follow
logically
from
general
assumptions
about
the
nature
of
human
language
they
are
regarded
as
explanations
and
the
general
hypotheses
are
supported
theoretical
linguists
tend
to
think
of
themselves
as
scientists
and
of
their
activities
as
following
the
methodologies
of
science
they
observe
phenom
ena
make
general
statements
to
describe
their
observations
hypothesize
what
else
should
be
true
if
their
generalizations
are
true
and
test
whether
they
were
correct
if
they
are
correct
they
create
more
hypotheses
and
test
again
if
they
are
incorrect
they
revise
their
generalizations
and
hypotheses
and
test
again
in
a
sense
they
want
to
be
wrong
when
they
find
where
they
are
wrong
they
can
improve
their
original
formulation
and
account
for
a
wider
range
of
data
delahunty
and
garvey
than
before
linguistic
study
from
this
point
of
view
is
not
a
hunt
for
errors
but
rather
a
dynamic
ongoing
creative
task
subject
to
constant
criticism
and
revision
it
is
important
to
understand
this
because
not
to
do
so
leads
to
several
misconceptions
language
rules
from
this
perspective
are
not
a
body
of
immutable
laws
or
conventions
discovered
or
imposed
by
scholars
they
are
reflections
of
our
current
understanding
of
the
phenomena
of
natural
language
it
is
also
important
not
to
see
this
as
an
endorsement
of
the
view
that
anything
goes
in
english
these
days
in
the
last
two
centuries
linguists
have
discovered
an
enormous
amount
about
many
individual
languages
and
much
about
natural
language
in
general
consequently
particularly
since
the
late
s
new
understandings
about
the
nature
of
human
beings
and
the
hu
man
mind
have
emerged
these
have
provided
far
richer
models
of
how
hu
man
beings
learn
remember
and
solve
problems
than
were
available
before
furthermore
we
have
discovered
a
great
deal
about
the
relationships
between
language
culture
and
society
it
turns
out
that
we
and
other
creatures
are
far
more
complex
than
we
had
given
ourselves
or
them
credit
for
exercise
what
implications
do
you
think
the
scientific
study
of
language
might
have
for
psychology
computer
science
education
and
law
as
we
noted
we
do
not
believe
that
anything
goes
in
english
or
in
any
language
languages
and
language
varieties
are
rule-governed
if
they
weren’t
we
wouldn’t
be
able
to
understand
each
other
some
forms
are
meaningful
grammatical
or
acceptable
others
are
meaningless
ungrammatical
or
unac
ceptable
the
status
of
an
expression
is
judged
against
the
rules
that
constitute
the
grammar
of
the
language
or
variety
and
the
rules
of
appropriateness
of
utterances
to
specific
situations
if
the
grammar
cannot
assign
a
meaning
to
the
utterance
then
it
will
be
either
completely
or
partially
meaningless
if
the
utterance
is
not
in
accord
with
the
structural
rules
of
the
language
then
it
will
be
ungrammatical
if
the
utterance
is
inappropriate
in
a
given
situation
or
context
then
it
is
unacceptable

on
the
careful

by

ing
from

to

in
spite
of
its
many
contributions
linguistics
has
not
had
its
full
impact
on
education
perhaps
teachers
fear
the
technicalities
of
a
discipline
that
claims
english
study
to
be
a
science
some
may
see
linguistics
as
a
threat
to
tradi
tional
values
in
teaching
the
reason
may
be
that
mainstream
linguistics
is
an
independent
discipline
with
its
own
objectives
and
methods
and
which
has
not
embraced
the
poststructuralist
and
postmodernist
approaches
adopted
in
literature
and
composition
studies
this
is
an
ironic
turn
because
the
roots
of
all
of
these
approaches
lie
in
early
twentieth
century
linguistics
in
spite
of
this
divergence
of
interests
we
are
convinced
that
teachers
are
best
served
by
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
language
and
the
ways
it
is
approached
by
linguists
one
of
the
aims
of
this
book
is
to
initiate
you
into
the
linguistic
point
of
view
and
to
provide
you
with
the
linguistic
literacy
that
you
will
need
in
the
contemporary
classroom
as
we
have
tried
to
show
in
this

applied
work
grows
out
of
theoretical
and
analytical
frameworks
moreover
theoreti

can
provide

with
intellectually

introduction
this
chapter
has
a
number
of
purposes
first
it
aims
to
place
the
study
of
grammar
within
the
larger
study
of
discourse
and
text
second
it
aims
to
provide
a
review
of
traditional
grammatical
concepts
and
terminol
ogy
for
those
who
have
studied
grammar
before
if
you
have
not
studied
grammar
before
it
will
give
a
very
simple
introduction
to
grammatical
ideas
and
plenty
of
practice
in
using
those
ideas
in
straightforward
exer
cises
third
it
provides
a
basis
for
the
deeper
and
more
critical
study
of
language
that
we
present
in
the
remainder
of
this
book
and
in
book
ii
in
this
chapter
we
only
provide
examples
of
concepts
we
do
not
justify
those
concepts
or
their
application
though
we
will
sketch
how
to
justify
analyses
in
our
section
on
form
function
and
meaning
our
goal
is
to
help
you
get
up
to
speed
in
recognizing
basic
grammatical
elements
because
the
presentation
in
the
following
chapters
progresses
from
the
smallest
units
sounds
and
works
upward
to
the
largest
sentences
we
begin
this
chapter
with
the
largest
units
clauses
and
sentences
and
work
downward
to
the
smallest
we
use
language
to
communicate
with
each
other
this
communica
tion
may
occur
in
conversation
which
can
be
either
directly
face-to
face
or
mediated
by
some
technology
such
as
the
telephone
we
may
also
com
municate
by
writing
to
each
other
communication
in
which
language
is
used
is
called
discourse
and
the
products
of
discourse
are
called
texts
which
can
be
recordings
of
spoken
communication
or
the
writings
that
constitute
a
written
discourse
discourse
is
coherent
cohesive
contex
tualized
and
purposeful
communicative
activity
we
will
have
more
to
delahunty
and
garvey
say
about
discourse
and
texts
in
our
chapter
on
discourse
the
texts
that
realize
a
discourse
are
composed
of
various
kinds
of
linguistic
units
the
most
important
of
which
is
the
sentence
the
sentence
is
the
largest
unit
to
which
the
grammatical
rules
of
a
language
apply
sentences
are
com
posed
of
one
or
more
clauses
a
clause
is
composed
of
at
least
two
phrases
one
of
which
plays
the
role
of
subject
the
other
of
predicate
phrases
are
composed
of
one
or
more
words
functioning
as
a
single
grammatical
unit
words
are
composed
of
morphemes
morphemes
are
meaningful
sequences
of
phonemes
units
of
sound
phonemes
are
the
units
of
sound
that
distinguish
words
or
morphemes
from
each
other
they
are
repre
sented
more
or
less
adequately
by
letters
of
the
alphabet
clauses
because
sentences
are
composed
of
one
or
more
clauses
we
begin
with
a
discussion
of
the
latter
clauses
represent
simple
states
of
affairs
these
may
be
states
or
events
states
are
unchanging
situations
events
are
situations
in
which
something
changes

simplest
type
of

a
very
simple
question
what
is
the
typical
order
of
subject
and
predicate
in
english
clauses
besides
occurring
before
the
predicate
subjects
are
often
defined
as
the
phrase
that
represents
something
about
which
something
is
said
by
the
predicate
or
about
which
the
predicate
answers
a
question
for
instance
we
can
view
the
subjects
italicized
in
the
following
clauses
as
representing
something
about
which
the
predicates
bolded
say
something

answer
a
question

are
traditionally
viewed
as
the
expression
denoting
the
receiver
of
or
the
entity
directly
affected
by
the
situation
represented
by
the
verb
thus
if
the
subject
represents
the
agent
of
the
action
denoted
by
the
verb
then
the
subject
does
whatever
is
denoted
by

indirect
object

second
is
the
direct
object
again
note
that
each
can
consist
of
one
or
more
words
t
raditionally
the
indirect
object
is
viewed
as
the
phrase
that
represents
the
recipient
of
whatever
is
denoted
by
the
direct
object
or
the
benefi
ciary
of
whatever
situation
is
denoted

clause
types
at
this
point
we
will
distinguish
seven
types
of
clauses
we
begin
with
the
voice
distinction
between
active
and
passive
versions
of
sentences
sentence
a
is
active
and
b
is
its
passive
version
a
richard
dawkins
wrote
a
devil’s
chaplain
delahunty
and
garvey
b
a
devil’s
chaplain
was
written
by
richard
dawkins
note
that
the
passive
version
has
a
form
of
be
was
as
an
auxiliary
verb
and
a
phrase
beginning
with
by
note
also
that
the
subject
of
the
passive
a
devil’s
chaplain
corresponds
to
the
object
of
the
active
and
that
the
object
of
by
richard
dawkins
corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
active
the
by
phrase
is
optional
it
can
often
be
omitted
without
reducing
the
sentence
to
a
fragment
c
someone
has
abandoned
this
car
d
this
car
has
been
abandoned
we
distinguish
three
sentence
types
according
to
different
moods
the
declarative
the
interrogative
and
the
imperative
sentences
a
through
f
are
declarative
a.k.a
indicative
e
john
should
be
here
soon
f
fred
left
early
note
that
the
subject
of
e
john
is
before
the
auxiliary
verb
should
and
in
f
the
subject
fred
is
before
the
main
verb
left
declarative
sentences
are
typically
used
to
make
assertions
although
like
all
sentence
types
they
can
be
used
for
several
purposes
imperative
sentences
contain
neither
a
subject
nor
an
auxiliary
verb
g
get
up
h
stop
that
imperative
sentences
are
typically
used
to
give
orders
directions
and
in
structions
for
instance
the
instructions
in
cookbooks
are
typically
written
in
the
imperative
mix
the
chopped
apple
with
the
other
ingredients
and
pour
into
greased
pan
there
are
two
main
types
of
interrogative
sentences
yes/no
interroga
tives
so
called
because
they
are
used
when
a
yes
or
no
answer
is
expected
and
wh
or
information
interrogatives
which
are
used
when
a
more
elab
orate
answer
than
just
yes
or
no
is
expected
sentence
i
is
a
yes/no
inter
rogative
note
that
its
auxiliary
verb
will
comes
before
its
subject
john
i
will
john
be
here
soon
a
skeletal
introduction
to
english
grammarremember
that
when
a
sentence
contains
more
than
one
auxiliary
verb
it
is
the
first
of
these
that
moves
to
the
left
of
the
subject
j
will
john
be
leaving
soon
k
is
a
wh-interrogative
it
begins
with

occurs
before
its

be
sleeping
here
the
first
auxiliary
and
not
can
be
contracted
into
a
single
word
m
you
shouldn’t
be

negative
sentences
may
be
declarative
like
l

they
can
also
be
interrogative
n

they

as

and
more
importantly
they

grammatical
elements
this

sentences
come
in
a
variety
of
shapes
and
sizes
some
consist
of
only
a
single

that
is
they

simple
sentences
and
have
only
one
main

one
subject
and
one

though
they
may
include
modifiers
of

sorts
a
useful
way
to

is
to
count
main

complementation
and
modification
words
phrases
and
sentences
play
several
roles
in
language
two
of
which
are
complementation
and
modification
we
have
already
seen
these
roles
in
examples
but
have
not
discussed
them
per
se
we
will
do
that
here
complementation
when
one
element
in
an
expression
creates
the
expectation
that
anoth
er
expression
will
also
occur
the
expected
element
complements
i.e
completes
the
expecting
element
note
the
spelling
compl
ements
not
compl
iments
for
example
a
preposition
like
on
requires
a
phrase
denot
ing
notions
such
as
location
or
time
as
in
on
the
pavement
on
time
on
your
mark
and
a
verb
such
as
buy
requires
a
phrase
denoting
something
bought
as
in
buy
lunch
exercise
identify
the
entire
complement
phrase
in
each
of
the
following
expres
sions
for
example
to
the
store
a
for
better
or
worse
b
keep
the
change
c
during
the
storm
d
sell
your
car
e
at
an
important
juncture
modification
a
word
alone
denotes
an
entire
class
of
things
for
example
motorcycle
denotes
the
entire
class
of
things
we
call
motorcycles
when
one
expres
sion
is
modified
by
another
then
generally
the
two
expressions
together
denote
only
a
subset
of
the
things
denoted
by
the
unmodified
expression
for
example
in
the
phrase
harley-davidson
motorcycles
the
head
motor
cycles
is
modified
by
harley-davidson
and
consequently
the
whole
phrase
denotes
just
those
motorcycles
that
are
harley-davidsons
phrases
may
include
many
modifiers
as
in
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
short-haired
cat
here
we
have
six
modifiers
each
restricting
the
potential
reference
of
the
word
cat
the
result
of
piling
on
these
modifiers
is
that
the
referent
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
all
of
them—it
must
be
a
cat
that
is
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
and
short-haired
each
modifier
acts
like
a
criterion
that
the
ultimate
referent(s
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
notice
that
modifiers
are
not
required
or
implied
by
the
expressions
a
skeletal
introduction
to
english
grammarthey
modify
these
expressions
would
be
grammatically
complete
without
the
modifiers—though
of
course
adding
or
removing
modifiers
affects
the
meaning
and
consequently
the
referents
of
the
modified
expressions
exercise

the
modifier(s
in
each
of
the
following

usually
recog

eight
such

not
a

may
be
gathered
into
two
groups
the

the

lexical
words
are
an
open
class
in
the
sense
that
new
words
may
be
added
fairly
freely
the
grammatical
classes
are
closed
meaning
that
it
is
harder
to
add
new
members
to
them
the
lexical
class
words
also
convey
the
main
meaning
elements
of
sentences

the
grammatical

to
perform
grammatical
functions

sounds
and

must
be
kept
conceptually
distinct
we
should
always
be
clear
about
whether
we
are
discussing
sounds
or
letters
long
before
any
one
wrote
people
spoke
to
each
other
when
we
learned
our
first
language
a
skeletal
introduction
to
english
grammarwe
learned
the
spoken
version
before
we
learned
the
written
one
when
we
learned
to
read
and
write
we
probably
learned
to
associate
letters
with
sounds
first
one
letter
to
a
sound
and
vice
versa
for
example
we
learned
to
use
the
letter
s
to
represent
its
most
typical
hissing
sound
s
later
we
learned
that
many
letters
are
associated
with
several
sounds
and
vice
versa
for
example
c
sometimes
represents
the
sound
typically
associated
with
s
as
in
city
and
sometimes
the
sound
typically
associated
with
k
as
in
cat
and
sometimes
both
as
in
electric
k
and
electricity
s
sounds
are
more
basic
to
language
than
letters
letters
represent
sounds
not
the
other
way
around
having
said
that
however
we
must
also
ac
knowledge
that
in
highly
literate
societies
such
as
ours
the
written
version
of
language
has
more
prestige
than
the
spoken
version—because
it
is
gener
ally
associated
with
more
prestigious
functions
we
are
so
literate
that
even
when
we
are
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
sounds
of
our
languages
we
are
strongly
influenced
by
how
they
are
spelled
we
tend
to
see
sounds
rather
than
to
hear
them
we
hope
that
our
chapter
on
phonetics
and
phonology
will
redress
that
imbalance
letters
as
we
mentioned
are
visual
symbols
for
sounds
english
has
ap
proximately
sounds
that
it
uses
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
if
we
were
to
design
an
ideal
writing
system
for
a
language
like
english
we
might
consider
associating
each
significant
sound
with
a
single
letter
how
ever
our
letters
derive
from
latin
which
got
them
from
etruscan
which
got
them
from
greek
which
got
them
from
phoenician
so
they’ve
been
around
the
block
quite
a
bit
and
don’t
fit
the
language
very
consistently
there
are
only
of
them
to
represent
the
or
so
sounds
this
disparity
is
particularly
acute
among
the
vowels
for
which
we
have
just
symbols
counting
y
to
represent
about
a
dozen
different
vowel
sounds
i
does
at
least
double
duty
it
represents
different
sounds
in
bit
and
bite
the
silent
e
alerts
us
to
the
difference
and
many
sounds
are
represented
in
several
ways
the
sound
f
as
in
father
may
be
represented
by
the
letters
f
in
frankly
ph
in
physics
and
gh
in
enough
while
the
letters
themselves
came
to
english
and
other
european
lan
guages
from
latin
english
borrowed
lots
of
words
from
lots
of
other
lan
guages
often
keeping
a
version
of
the
original
language’s
spelling
the
result
is
that
the
way
we
spell
particular
sounds
often
depends
on
the
word
the
sound
is
in
and
where
that
word
came
from
for
example
the
sound
f
is
written
as
the
letter
f
in
native
english
words
such
as
feather
and
finger
however
the
same
sound
is
spelled
ph
in
many
words
that
were
borrowed
into
english
from
greek
such
as
phone
or
philadelphia
the
sounds
used
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
in
a
language
are
delahunty
and
garvey
called
phonemes
p
and
b
distinguish
pat
and
bat
so
they
are
english
phonemes
but
phonemes
are
pronounced
differently
in
different
contexts
if
you
listen
carefully
you
will
notice
that
the
p
of
pat
differs
from
the
p
of
spat
the
former
p
is
considerably
breathier
than
the
latter
the
different
pro
nunciations
of
a
phoneme
are
its
allophones
the
pronunciation
differences
among
the
allophones
of
a
phoneme
do
not
distinguish
among
words
in
a
language
for
instance
there
is
no
pair
of
separate
english
words
which
are
identical
except
that
where
one
member
of
the
pair
has
breathy
p
where
the
other
has
non-breathy
p
exercise
identify
three
more
instances
in
which
english
spells
a
single
sound
in
more
than
one
way
and
three
more
instances
in
which
an
english
letter
or
group
of
letters
represents
more
than
one
sound
form
function
and
meaning
our
discussion
has
depended
on
concepts
that
we
must
now
discuss
some
what
more
fully
these
are
the
notions
of
form
observable
grammatical
characteristics
function
role
or
relation
in
an
expression
and
meaning
what
an
expression
denotes
or
refers
to
the
information
encoded
by
an
expression
form
the
notion
of
form
refers
to
the
observable
elements
that
make
an
object
what
it
is
a
toothbrush
for
instance
has
the
formal
features
of
a
–
long
narrow
handle
with
a
bunch
of
bristles
at
one
end
individual
toothbrushes
might
have
other
formal
characteristics
such
as
a
particular
color
particular
stiffness
of
bristles
devices
for
massaging
the
gums
etc
but
only
the
first
two
formal
features
must
be
present
for
something
to
be
identified
as
a
toothbrush
in
grammar
we
make
use
of
formal
features
to
identify
the
category
that
an
expression
belongs
to
in
the
study
of
parts
of
speech
for
example
the
form
of
a
word
comprises
its
observable
linguistic
properties
besides
whether
it
is
spoken
gestured
or
written
these
formal
features
include
a
actual
and
potential
inflectional
elements
e.g

operations
such
as
substitution
e.g
the
woman
may
be
replaced
by
the
pronoun
she
in
a
sentence
these
features
serve
as
the
basic
criteria
for
identifying
parts
of
speech
for
instance
consider
how
we
might
assign
the
word
realize
to
the
class
of
verbs
first
it
has
the
potential
to
accept
inflectional
endings
typical
of

with
verbs

realize

finally
it
can
be
replaced
along
with
its
associated
ele
ments
by
the
form

as

that
in
this

not

of
the
criteria
are
useful
stress
tells
us
little
about
the
part
of
speech
of
realize
but
in
words
such
as
convért
verb
and
cónvert
noun
stress
provides
a
useful
clue
much
of
the
skill
involved
in
linguistic
analysis
requires
the
use
of
appropriate
formal
tests
applying
them
shows
that
a
any
word
is
potentially
a
member
of
several
different
parts
of
speech
e.g
hit
can
be
both
a
noun
and
a
verb
b
the
meaning
of
a
word
provides
no
reliable
clue
to
its
part
of
speech
e.g
verbs
are
often
characterized
as
words
that
denote
actions
or
states
but
the
words
actions
and
states
are
both
nouns
c
distinguishing
the
formal
properties
of
words
is
a
necessary
prelimi
nary
to
assigning
them
to
a
class
d
formal
criteria
apply
in
different
ways
to
different
words
in
the
case
of
realize
inflectional
and
derivational
clues
were
available
in
the
case
of
convert
stress
information

available
but
for
a
word
such
as
since
we
would
have
had
to
rely
on
its
potential
positions
in
sentences
function
the
functional
view
of

asks
what
is
an
expression’s
role
in
its

an
analogy
let’s
return

than

you
may

typically

the

that

thus
a

head
will
be
a
noun
phrase
one
with
a
verb
head
will
be
a
verb
phrase
and
so
on
meaning
the
third
perspective
on
grammar
is
that
of
meaning
i.e
the
definition
of
an
expression
or
the
information
potentially
communicated
by
it
in
this
topic
we
include
the
meaning
of
words
phrases
and
whole
sentences
a
simple
example
of
lexical
word
meaning
used
in
grammatical
analysis
is
the
familiar
definition
of
a
verb
as
a
word
that
denotes
action
or
state
of
being
another
familiar
example
is
the
traditional
definition
of
the
subject
of
a
clause
as
the
doer
of
an
action
several
chapters
in
this
book
will
say
more
about
such
constructional
meanings
in
regard
to
phrases
clauses
and
entire
sentences
our
position
in
this
book
is
that
the
study
of
grammar
can
take
place
most
successfully
when
built
on
a
solid
base
of
formal
analysis
thus
our
chapters
on
parts
of
speech
identify
parts
of
speech
primarily
by
analyzing
their
forms
our
emphasis
on
form
does
not
at
all
imply
that
function
or
meaning
is
unimportant
to
language
exactly
the
opposite
is
true
and
we
do
include
functional
and
semantic
commentary
on
parts
of
speech
and
other
grammati
cal
forms
however
we
will
not
rely
solely
or
even
primarily
on
function
or
meaning
as
criteria
for
identification
as
we
proceed
to
phrases
and
clauses
we
will
be
able
to
make
a
more
extensive
use
of
the
functional
and
meaning
ful
properties
of
grammar
precisely
because
of
our
strong
formal
foundation
our
goal
is
to
help
you
make
appropriate
use
of
all
these
facets
in
your
think
ing
and
teaching
about
language

introduction
in
this
chapter
we
sketch
the
pronunciation
system
of
english
we
begin
with
phonetics
a
system
for
describing
and
recording
the
sounds
of
lan
guage
objectively
phonetics
provides
a
valuable
way
of
opening
our
ears
to
facets
of
language
that
we
tend
to
understand
by
reference
to
their
written
rather
than
their
actual
spoken
forms
phonology
concerns
itself
with
the
ways
in
which
languages
make
use
of
sounds
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
teachers
should
be
knowledgeable
about
the
phonetics
and
phonology
of
english
because
the
sound
system
is
primary
and
the
basis
for
the
spelling
system
they
may
have
to
teach
english
pronunciation
to
stu
dents
who
are
not
native
speakers
of
english
they
may
have
to
teach
poetry
which
requires
that
they
teach
about
rhyme
alliteration
assonance
and
other
poetic
devices
that
manipulate
sound
it
is
important
to
un
derstand
accents
and
language
variation
and
to
react
appropriately
to
them
and
to
teach
appropriate
language
attitudes
about
them
to
students
see
our
chapters
on
language
and
society
and
usage
in
book
ii
we
are
so
liter
ate
that
we
tend
to
hear
the
sounds
of
our
language
through
its
spelling
system
and
phonetics
phonology
provides
a
corrective
to
that
and
pho
netics
and
phonology
provide
systematic
and
well-founded
understandings
of
the
sound
patterns
of
english
articulatory
phonetics
we
have
three
goals
in
this
section
first
we
introduce
you
to
the
ways
in
which
the
sounds
of
english
are
produced
second
we
develop
a
system
for
classifying
speech
sounds
on
the
basis
of
how
they
are
produced
simultane
ously
we
introduce
an
alphabet
approximating
that
developed
by
the
inter
national
phonetics
association
ipa
which
will
allow
us
to
refer
to
sounds
quite
precisely
when
we
want
to
indicate
that
letters
are
to
be
interpreted
as
phonetic
symbols
we
enclose
them
in
square
brackets
and
when
we
want
to
indicate
that
letters
are
to
be
interpreted
as
letters
from
an
ordinary
spelling
system
we
enclose
them
in
angled
brackets
delahunty
and
garvey
the
phonetic
alphabet
uses
many
of
the
letters
of
the
english
alphabet
but
their
pronunciations
are
very
restricted
and
are
not
always
the
ones
you
might
expect
in
this
system
there
are
no
silent
letters—every
phonetic
symbol
represents
an
actual
sound
every
letter
always
has
the
same
pronunciation
regardless
of
its
context
no
letter
has
more
than
one
pronunciation
and
no
sounds
are
represented
by
more
than
one
letter
to
make
fine
distinctions
phoneticians
add
special
symbols
called
diacritics
to
the
basic
letters
for
some
english
sounds
and
for
languages
other
than
english
symbols
not
from
the
english
alphabet
have
been
devised
you
might
visit
the
ipa
web
site
for
a
full
listing
of
the
symbols
in
the
sections
to
follow
we
describe
the
sounds
represented
by
these
symbols
and
how
these
sounds
are
made
as
we
go
through
these
sections
pay
attention
to
the
ways
in
which
individual
sounds
are
ordinarily
spelled
in
english
as
well
as
to
the
phonetic
spellings
to
produce
speech
air
must
flow
from
the
lungs
through
the
vocal
tract
which
includes
the
vocal
folds
popularly
called
the
vocal
cords
though
they
are
more
like
thick
elastic
bands
than
strings
the
nose
or
nasal
cav
ity
and
the
mouth
or
oral
cavity
see

the
vocal
folds
vibrate

sounds

air
flows

nose
for
certain
sounds

the
main
creator

these

approximants
are
more
sonorant
resonant
i.e
naturally
loud
than
consonants

less

english
has
three
kinds
of
approximants
lateral
approximants
are
made
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
alveolar
ridge
while
allowing
the
air
to
pass
along
one
or
both
sides
as
in
l]—in
lack
call
and
callow
central
approximants
are
made
by
raising
the
sides
of
the
tongue
so
that
the
air
flows
along
the
center
of
the
tongue
as
in
r]—in
rock
roll
and
rory
r
is
regarded
as
an
alveolar
sound
glides
semivowels
come
in
two
kinds
palatal
and
labio
velar
palatal
delahunty
and
garvey
glides
are
made
by
raising
the
tongue
toward
the
hard
palate
close
to
where
the
vowel
in
eat
is
made

first
sound
of

labio
velar
glides
are
made
by
rounding
the
lips
and
simultaneously
raising
the
back
of
the
tongue
toward
the
velum
close
to
where
the
vowel
sound
of
ooze
is
made

a
second
set
of
english
diphthongs
is
not
as
clearly
distinguished
as
the
first
primarily
because
we
tend
to
perceive
them
as
simple
vowels
however
in
a
precise
narrow
phonetic
transcription
they
must
be
represented
as
diphthongs
the
tense
front
vowel

is
diphthongized

fully
you
will
notice
that
the
vowel
of
bate
is
actually
pronounced
ei
the
tense
back
vowel
o
is
also
diphthongized
if
you
listen
carefully
you
will
notice
that
the
vowel
of
boat
is
actually
pronounced
ou
so
the
front
tense
vowel
is
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
front
vowel
and
the
back
tense
vowel
is
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
back
vowel
we
can
express
this
pattern
as
a
rule
mid
and
high
tense
vowels
are
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
high
lax
vowel
that
matches
the
original
vowel
in

diphthongization
of
these

is
a
feature
of
english
rather
than
a
universal
feature
of
natural
language
other
languages
notably
spanish

german
do
not
diphthongize
their

the
tendency
to

it’s
a
lot
easier
to
count
syllables
than
to
give
them
a
satisfactory
definition
if
the
entire
class
were
to
count
the
syllables
in
this
paragraph
there
would
be
considerable
agreement
about
the
number
but
probably
not
about
where
each
syllable
begins
and
ends
the
fact
that

oped

sug
gests
that
syllables
are
very
salient
linguistic
units
that
children
seem
to
be
able
to
associate
symbols
with
syllables
before
they
can
associate
symbols
delahunty
and
garvey
with
phonetic
segments
also
points
to
the
importance
of
the
syllable
every
syllable
symbolized
as
consists
of
at
least
a
nucleus
symbolized
as
n
which
is
typically
a
vowel
the
nucleus
may
be
preceded
by
an
onset
symbolized
as
o
consisting
of
one
or
more
consonants
and
followed
by
a
coda
symbolized
as
c
again
consisting
of
one
or
more
consonants
the
nucleus
and
the
coda
together
make
up
a
unit
called
the

a

is
usually

a

with
high
sonority
such
as
l,r,m,n,n
may
also
be

the

level
of
a
syllable
thus
rises
from
the

if
there
is
one
up
to
a

in
the

and
falls
off
again
in
the

in
this

the

of

the

it

phonology
is
the
study
of
how
the
speech

of
a

are
used
in
that
language
to
distinguish
meaningful

the

to
take

does
not
in
this
section
we
explore
phonology
and
the
basic
unit
of
phonological
analysis
the

phonemes
you
might
reasonably
have
assumed
that
whenever
speakers
distinguish
be
tween
a
pair
of
sounds
they
will
use
that
difference
to
distinguish
between
words
for
example
we
know
that
english
speakers
distinguish
between
s
and
z
and
we
use
this
difference
to
signal
the
difference
between
the
words
sip
and
zip
we
will
say
that
s
and
z
contrast
with
each
other
in
english
in
fact
all
of
the
sounds
we
have
described
so
far
contrast
with
each
other
in
english
and
so
are
used
by
english
speakers
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
you
can
test
this
out
by
taking
any
pair
of
sounds
as
we
took
s
and
z
and
creating
a
pair
of
words
like
sip
and
zip
which
are
identical
except
that
where
one
has
one
sound
the
other
has
the
other
sound
just
as
where
sip
has
s
zip
has
z
pairs
of
words
like
this
are
called
minimal
pairs
and
are
used
to
demonstrate
that
pairs
of
sounds
are
used
in
a
language
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
sound
units
that
distinguish
words
from
each
other
are
called
phonemes
we
enclose
phonemes
in
e.g
s
z
to
distinguish
them
from
sounds
s
z
and
ordinary
letters

exercise
phonemes
are
most
easily
identified
through
minimal

thus
pete

in

we

you

can
you
now
say
how
they
differ
we
phonetics
and
phonologyhope
you
said
that
one
was
longer
than
the
other
now
listen
to
the
conso
nants
after
the
vowels
are
these
the
same
or
different
again
we
hope
you
said
different
and
that
you
know
that
t
is
voiceless
and
d
is
voiced
now
which
vowel
the
longer
or
the
shorter
precedes
d
and
which
precedes
t
we
hope
you
said
that
the
longer
vowel
precedes
the
voiced
consonant
are
the
two
vowels
similar
in
any
way
again
we
hope
you
said
that
they
seem
to
be
longer
and
shorter
versions
of
the
same
vowel

let’s
use
to
indicate
extra
length
so
the
vowel
before
voiceless
t
is
just

but
the
one
before
voiced
d
is

now
let’s
listen
to
some
more
word
pairs
like
cat
and
cad
root
rood
moat
mode
leaf
leave
gape
gabe
listen
to
the
vowels
in
each
pair
you
should
hear
that
the
vowel
in
the
sec
ond
word
in
each
pair
is
a
little
longer
than
the
vowel
in
the
first
now
determine
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
consonants
after
the
vowels
in
each
word
pair
you
should
find
that
the
consonant
in
the
first
word
is
the
voiceless
version
of
the
consonant
in
the
second
word
t
urning
our
attention
again
to
the
vowels
in
each
word
pair
how
are
they
related
we
hope
you
said
that
they
were
very
similar
vowels
specifi
cally
short
and
long
versions
of
the
same
vowel
you
should
now
be
able
to
determine
a
very
general
rule
of
english
when
are
vowels
lengthened
and
when
are
they
not
lengthened
your
answer
should
be
something
along
the
lines
of
english
vowels
are
lengthened
when
they
occur
before
a
voiced
consonant
otherwise
they
are
not
lengthened
so
far
we’ve
seen

and

u
and
u
o
and
o
i
and
i
and
e
and
e
in
each
case
the
longer
vowel
occurs
before
a
voiced
consonant
we’ve
also
noted
that
the
vowels
are
otherwise
virtually
identical—they
dif
fer
only
in
length
so
it
makes
good
sense
to
regard
these
pairs
of
vowel
sounds
as
slightly
different
pronunciations
of
the
same
vowel
and
that
whether
the
vowel
is
lengthened
or
not
depends
on
whether
the
consonant
that
follows
it
is
voiced
or
not
importantly
the
long
and
short
pairs
of
vowels
do
not
contrast
with
each
other
english
contains
no
pairs
of
words
that
are
identical
except
that
where
one
contains
a
short
version
of
a
vowel
the
other
contains
the
longer
version
of
the
same
vowel
consequently
the
long
and
short
versions
of
delahunty
and
garvey
vowels
do
not
represent
separate
phonemes
let’s
now
turn
our
attention
to
some
consonants
for
example
english
speakers
pronounce
the
t
in
toll
differently
from
that
in
stole
the
t
of
toll
is
breathier
than
the
t
of
stole
the
former
is
said
to
be
aspirated
and
the
latter
unaspirated
we
represent
the
aspirated
t
as
th
with
the
diacritic
h
indicating
aspiration
we
represent
the
unaspirated
t
as
t
with
no
dia
critic
the
important
point
here
is
that
english
speakers
do
not
signal
any
difference
in
meaning
with
the
difference
between
th
and
t
they
treat
the
two
sounds
as
variant
ways
of
pronouncing
the
the
same
sound
sub
stituting
one
of
these
sounds
for
the
other
would
not
affect
the
meaning
of
a
word
but
it
would
create
an
odd
and
perhaps
non-native
pronunciation
of
the
word
no
pair
of
english
words
is
distinguished
solely
by
the
difference
between
t
and
th
you
can
satisfy
yourself
that
this
is
so
by
trying
to
find
a
minimal
pair
of
english
words
differentiated
solely
by
the
fact
that
where
one
has
an
aspirated
consonant
the
other
has
an
unaspirated
version
of
that
same
consonant
don’t
spend
too
long
trying
let’s
now
look
at
a
different
pair
of
english
sounds
if
we
replace
the
t
in
r
at
rot
with
d
then
we
get
the
sequence
of
sounds
r
ad
rod
which
of
course
is
quite
distinct
in
meaning
from
rot
clearly
english
speakers
treat
the
difference
between
d
and
t
differently
from
the
way
they
treat
the
difference
between
th
and
t
and
between
longer
and
shorter
versions
of
vowels
in
the
case
of
t
and
d
the
difference
can
signal
a
difference
in
meaning
in
the
other
cases
it
cannot
differences
in
sound
that
signal
differences
in
meaning
are
said
to
be
phonemic
distinctive
or
contrastive
differences
in
sound
that
do
not
signal
meaning
differences
are
non
distinctive
or
non-contrastive
one
objective
of
phonology
is
to
identify
which
sound
differences
are
contrastive
and
which
are
not
as
we
have
seen
the
contrastive
sound
units
are
called
phonemes
phonemes
and
allophones
a
good
way
to
think
about
a
phoneme
is
as
a
group
of
phonetically
similar
sounds
that
are
treated
as
members
of
the
same
sound
category
because
the
members
of
a
sound
category
are
treated
as
the
same
sound
in
a
language
they
cannot
be
used
for
communicating
differences
in
meaning
english
speakers
treat
th
and
t
as
belonging
to
the
same
sound
category
so
they
cannot
be
used
to
distinguish
one
word
from
another
different
phonemes
are
different
categories
of
sounds
and
the
differences
among
these
catego
ries
can
signal
differences
in
meaning
english
speakers
treat
t
and
d
as
belonging
to
different
sound
categories—/t
and
d
respectively—and
so
phonetics
and
phonologythese
can
be
used
to
differentiate
one
word
from
another
sound
categories
are
abstractions
we
can
only
perceive
them
when
one
of
their
members
is
pronounced
the
sounds
that
make
up
the
category
are
called
the
allophones
of
that
phoneme
thus
t
and
th
are
allophones
of
the
english
phoneme
t
notice
that
the
individual
sound
symbols
are
the
same
as
those
we
used
for
phonetics
but
to
distinguish
phonology
from
phonetics
we
enclose
phonemes
in
slanted
brackets
and
use
square
brackets
for
phonetic
notation
perhaps
the
following
diagram

help

allophones

we
have
already
noted
that
if
we
substitute
the
aspirated
allophone
of
t
for
its
unaspirated
relative
then
we
create
an
odd
pronunciation
of
a
word
til
is
the
typical
american
english
pronunciation
of
till
but
til
is
not
what
if
any
patterns
can
we
observe
in
where
allophones
of
a
phoneme
can
and
cannot
occur
some
allophones
of
a
phoneme
are
in
complementary
distribution
that
is
they
occupy
different
positions
contexts
or
environments
in
words—where
one
can
occur
the
other
cannot
as
we
have
seen
english
has
a
very
general
pattern
of
lengthening
vowels
before
voiced
consonants
that
is
the
allophone
of
a
vowel
phoneme
before
a
voiced
consonant
will
be
appreciably
longer
up
to
three
times
longer
than
the
allophone
of
the
same
vowel
phoneme
before
a
voiceless
consonant
for
example
listen
to
the
pronunciation
of
e
in
bet
and
bed
you
should
have
little
difficulty
in
hearing
the
difference
in
vowel
length
we
can
represent
the
pattern
of
oc
currence
distribution
of
these
two
allophones
of
the
phoneme
e
as
the
following
phonological
rule
when
the
phoneme
e
occurs
before
a
voiceless
consonant
it
is
pronounced
as
its
allophone
e
when
it
occurs
before
a
voiced
consonant
it
is
pronounced
as
its
allophone
e
remember
is
a
diacritic
indicating
a
lengthened
sound
in
fact
the
rule
is
much
more
general
than
this
because
it
applies
to
all
vowels
we
can
write
it
as
in
english
a
vowel
is
longer
before
a
voiced
consonant
than
it
is
before
a
voiceless
one
one
of
our
objectives
in
studying
a
language
is
to
be
able
to
describe
these
sound
patterns
i.e
to
be
able
to
specify
in
the
most
general
terms
possible
the
phonetic
environments
in
which
each
allophone
occurs
let’s
look
at
another
very
systematic
set
of
english
vowel
allophones
the
vowels
of
cap
and
can
differ
phonetically
that
of
cap
is
a
plain

that
of
can
is
nasalized
represented
by
~~
if
you
have
trouble
hearing
the
difference
try
starting
to
say
each
word
normally
and
then
omit
the
final
consonant
the
phoneme

thus
has
the
allophones

and
~
in
fact
all
english
vowels
have
both
nasalized
and
non-nasalized
allophones
we
can
represent
this
as
the
rule
whenever
an
english
vowel
occurs
before
a
nasal
consonant
it
becomes
nasalized
otherwise
it
is
non-nasalized
phonetics
and
phonology
in
fact
the
situation
is
a
bit
more
intricate
that
this
because
nasals
are
voiced
we
should
expect
a
vowel
before
them
to
be
lengthened
relative
to
the
same
vowel
before
a
voiceless
sound
and
indeed
this
is
what
we
find
listen
to
the
vowels
in
cat
cad
and
can
you
should
notice
that
the
first
vowel
is
unlengthened

the
second
one
is
lengthened

and
the
third
one
is
both
lengthened
in
fact
probably
even
more
than
the
second
one
and
nasalized
~

phonological
rules
as
we
saw
above
a
phonological
rule
is
a
general
statement
about
the
distribution
of
a
phoneme’s
allophones
e.g
those
of
t
there
are
several
types
of
phonological
rules
to
represent
the
several
patterns
of
distribution
of
sounds
in
a
language
the
rule
for
the
th
allophone
of
t
can
be
seen
as
adding
extra
breathi
ness
after
the
release
of
a
voiceless
stop
this
rule
adds
the
aspiration
feature
to
the

the
nasal
pronunciation
of
the

is
due
as
we’ve
seen
to
the
influ
ence
of
the
nasal
consonant

the
end

one
word
when

thus
words
such
as
frost
and
ask
are
pronounced
as
fras
and
s
when
they
occur
before
consonants
e.g
ask
katie
this
effect
is

likely
when

the

is
phonetically

j
for
example
did

the
study
of
phonology
shows
that
languages
make
use
of
unpredict
able
units
phonemes
to
differentiate
words
from

it
also
shows
that
languages
employ
very
general
patterns
of
sounds
by
representing
the
general
predictable
patterns
as
phonological
rules
we
leave
only
that
in
formation
which
is
unpredictable
and
idiosyncratic
to
be
listed
in
the
set
of
phonemes
this
way
we
minimize
the
number
of
basic
phonemic
units
we
need
to
posit
we
also
minimize
the
number
of
times
any
given
piece
of
in
formation
is
mentioned
thus
simplifying
the
overall
grammar
or
descrip
tion
of
the
language
for
example
english
has
two
series
of
vowels
those
with
and
those
without
nasalization
the
nasalized
vowels
occur
only
be
fore
nasal
consonants
the
non-nasalized
ones
occur
everywhere
else
if
we
merely
listed
all
these
vowels
as
belonging
to
the
language
then
we
would
have
postulated
far
more
basic
units
than
we—or
native
speakers—really
need
and
we
would
have
missed
the
generalization
that
the
two
series
of
vowels
are
really
quite
alike
one
series
being
merely
a
predictable
positional
delahunty
and
garvey
variant
of
the
other
we
capture
this
generalization
by
eliminating
the
series
of
nasalized
vowels
from
our
inventory
of
basic
units
and
replacing
it
with
the
nasalization
rule

words
according

the
forms
that
words
can
show
up
in
although
the
matter
is
really
very
com

the

of
simplicity
we
will
begin
with
the
assumption
that
we
are
all
generally
able
to
distinguish
words
from
other
linguistic
units
it
will
be
sufficient
for
our
initial
purposes
if
we
assume
that
words
are
the
main
units
used
for
entries
in
dictionaries
in
a
later
section
we
will
briefly
describe
some
of
their
distinctive
characteristics
words
are
potentially
complex
units
composed
of
even
more
basic
units
called
morphemes
a

is
the
smallest
part
of
a
word
that
has
grammatical
function
or
meaning

not
the
smallest
unit
of

we
will
designate
them
in

analyzed
into
the
morphemes
saw

none
of
these
last
four
can
be
further
divided
into
meaningful
units
and
each
occurs
in
many
other
words
such
as
looked
mown
cough
ing
bakes
saw
can
occur
on
its
own
as
a
word
it
does
not
have
to
be
attached
to
another
morpheme
it

none

when

remove
them
we
are
left
with
move
which
cannot
be
further
di
vided
into
meaningful
pieces
and
so
must
be
the

we
must
distinguish

the

to
which
af

are
attached
in

words
words
are
notoriously
difficult
entities
to
define
both
in
universal
and
in
language
specific
terms
like
most
linguistic
entities
they
look
in
two
direc
tions—upward
toward
larger
units
of
which
they
are
parts
toward
phrases
and
downward
toward
their
constituent
morphemes
this
however
only
helps
us
understand
words
if
we
already
understand
how
they
are
combined
into
larger
units
or
divided
into
smaller
ones
so
we
will
briefly
discuss
sev
delahunty
and
garvey
eral
other
criteria
that
have
been
proposed
for
identifying
them
one
possible
criterion
is
spelling
in
written
english
text
we
tend
to
regard
as
a
word
any
expression
that
has
no
spaces
within
it
and
is
separated
by
spaces
from
other
expressions
while
this
is
a
very
useful
criterion
it
does
sometimes
lead
to
inconsistent
and
unsatisfactory
results
for
instance
cannot
is
spelled
as
one
word
but
might
not
as
two
compounds
words
com
posed
of
two
or
more
words
see
below
are
inconsistently
divided
cf
influx
in-laws
goose
flesh
low
income
vs
low-income
words
tend
to
resist
interruption
we
cannot
freely
insert
pieces
into
words
as
we
do
into
sentences
for
example
we
cannot
separate
the
root
of
a
word
from
its
inflectional
ending
by
inserting
another
word
as
in
sock
blue-s
for
blue
socks
sentences
in
contrast
can
be
interrupted
we
can
in
sert
adverbials
between
subjects
and
predicates
john
quickly
erased
his
fin
gerprints
by
definition
we
can
also
insert
the
traditional
interjections
we
will
i
believe
have
rain
later
today
in
english
though
by
no
means
in
all
languages
the
order
of
elements
in
words
is
quite
fixed
english
inflections
for
example
are
suffixes
and
are
added
after
any
derivational
morphemes
in
a
word
at
higher
levels
in
the
language
different
orders
of
elements
can
differ
in
meaning
compare
john
kissed
mary
with
mary
kissed
john
but
we
do
not
contrast
words
with
prefixed
inflections
with
words
with
suffixed
inflections
english
does
not
contrast
for
example
piece
s
with
s
piece
in
english
too
it
is
specific
individual
words
that
select
for
certain
in
flections
thus
the
word
child
is
pluralized
by
adding
ren
ox
by
adding
en
so
if
a
form
takes
the
en
plural
it
must
be
a
word
so
words
are
units
composed
of
one
or
more
morphemes
they
are
also
the
units
of
which
phrases
are
composed
english

inflectional

along

the

they

the

we

they
are
regular
because
they
are
the
inflections
added
to
the
vast
majority
of
verbs
nouns
adjectives
and
adverbs
to
indicate
grammatical
properties
such
as

number
and

they
are
also
the
inflections
we
typically
add
to
new
words
coming
into
the
language
for
example
we
add
s
to
the
noun
throughput
to
make
it
plural
when
we
borrow
words
from
other
languages
in
most
cases
we
add
the
regular
english
inflections
to
them
rather
than
borrow
the
inflections

formationthey
had
in

however
because
of
its
long
and
complex
history
english
like
all
lan
guages
has
many
irregular
forms
which
may
be
irregular
in
a
variety
of
ways
first
irregular
words
may
use
different
inflections
than
regular
ones
for
example
the
modern
past
participle
inflection
of
a
regular
verb
is
ed
but
the
past
participle
of
freeze
is
frozen
and
the
past
participle
of
break
is
broken
second
irregular
forms
may
involve
internal
vowel
changes
as
in
man/men
woman/women
grow/grew
ring/rang/rung
third
some
forms
derive
from
historically
unrelated
forms
went
the
past
tense
of
go
histori
cally
was
the
past
tense
of
a
different
verb
wend
this
sort
of
realignment
is
known
as
suppletion
other
examples
of
suppletion
include
good
better
and
best
and
bad
worse
and
worst
as
an
exercise
you
might
look
up
be
am
and
is
in
a
dictionary
that
provides
etymological
information
such
as
the
american
heritage
fourth
some
words
show
no
inflectional
change
sheep
is
both
singular
and
plural
hit
is
both
present
and
past
tense
as
well
as
past
participle
fifth
many
borrowed
words
especially
nouns
have
ir
regular
inflected
forms
alumnae
and
cherubim
are
the
plurals
of
alumna
and
delahunty
and
garvey
cherub
respectively
irregular
forms
demonstrate
the
abstract
status
of
morphemes
thus
the
word
men
realizes
represents
makes
real
the
two
morphemes
man
and
plural
women
realizes
woman
and
plural
went
realizes
go
and
past
tense
most
grammar
and
writing
textbooks
contain
long
lists
of
these
ex
ceptions
as
a
final
issue
here
we
must
note
that
different
groups
of
english
speak
ers
use
different
inflected
forms
of
words
especially
of
verbs
when
this
is
the
case
the
standard
variety
of
the
language
typically
selects
one
and
rejects
the
others
as
non-standard
or
illogically
as
not
english
or
worse
for
example
many
english
speakers
use
a
single
form
of
be
in
the
past
tense
was
regardless
of
what
the
subject
of
its
clause
is
so
they
will
say
we
was
there
yesterday
this
is
an
uncontroversial
issue
was
in
instances
like
this
is
universally
regarded
as
non-standard
other
forms
are
more
controversial
for
example
what
is
the
past
tense
of
dive—dived
or
dove
how
are
lie
and
lay
to
be
used
how
does
your
dictionary
deal
with
such
usage
issues
exercise
can
you
think
of
a
reliable
way
to
distinguish
the
past
tense
and
past
participle
of
a
verb
regardless
of
whether
it
is
regular
or
irregular

words
belonging
to
differ
ent
parts
of

take
different
inflections—e.g
nsaw
pl-s
vsaw
ed
because
derivationally
related
forms
often
belong
to
different
parts
of
speech
and
consequently
allow
different
inflections
and
because
the
mean
ings
of
derivationally
related
pairs
are
not
always
as
parallel
as
their
forms
are
derived
forms
may
be
given
their
own
entries
in
dictionaries
webster’s
new
world
dictionary
for
instance
has
separate
entries
for
generate
and
generation
and
for
compete
and
competence
look
up
these
words
in
your
own
dictionary

note
how
the
meanings
of

are

the
term
word

is
often
used
for
a
set
of
words
that
are
related
to
each
other
derivationally
or
inflectionally
though
the
term
is
also
used
to
refer
to
any
set
of
words
that
rhyme
with
each
other
compounding
the
italicized
words
in
are
created
by
combining
saw
with

other

with

such
words
are
called
compounds
they
contain
two
or
more
words
or
more
accurately
two
or
more
roots
all
one
or
none
of
which
may
be
bound
cf
blueberry
with
two
free
morphemes
and
astronaut
with
two
bound
morphemes
generally
one
of
the
words
is
the
head
of
the
com
pound
and
the
other(s
its
modifier(s

saw
is

the

compare
pack
rat
with

pack
generally
the
modifier
comes
before
the
head
in
ordinary
english
spelling
compounds
are
sometimes
spelled
as
single
words
as
in
sawmill
sawdust
sometimes
the
parts
are
connected
by
a
hy
phen
as
in
jig-saw
and
sometimes
they
are
spelled
as
two
words
as
in
chain
saw
oil
well
dictionaries
may
differ
in
their
spellings
nonetheless
we
are
justified
in
classifying
all
such
cases
as
compound
words
regardless
of
their
conventional
spelling
for
a
variety
of
reasons
first
the
stress
pattern
of
the
compound
word
is
usually
different
from
the
stress
pattern
in
the
phrase
composed
of
the
same
words
in
the
same

what
are
the
verbal
tricks
here
in
the
compounds
the
main
stress
is
on
the
first
word
in
the
phrases
the
main
stress
is
on
the
last
word
while
this
pattern
does
not
apply
to
all
com
pounds
it
is
so
generally
true
that
it
provides
a
very
useful
test
second
the
meaning
of
the
compound
may
differ
to
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
from
that
of
the
corresponding
phrase
a
blackbird
is
a
species
of
bird
regardless
of
its
color
a
black
bird
is
a
bird
which
is
black
regardless
of
its
species
a
trotting-horse
is
a
kind
of
horse
regardless
of
its
current
ac
tivity
a
trotting
horse
must
be
a
horse
that
is
currently
trotting
so
because
the
meanings
of
compounds
are
not
always
predictable
from
the
meanings
of
their
constituents
dictionaries
often
provide
individual
entries
for
them
they
do
not
do
this
for
phrases
unless
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
is
idi
omatic
and
therefore
not
derivable
from
the
meanings
of
its
parts
and
how
they
are
put
together
e.g
raining
cats
and
dogs
generally
the
meaning
of
a
phrase
is
predictable
from
the
meanings
of
its
constituents
and
so
phrases
need
not
be
listed
individually
indeed
because
the
number
of
possible
phrases
in
a
language
is
infinite
it
is
in
principle
impossible
to
list
them
all

there
are
a

of

the
most
accessible
of
which
is
to
classify
them
according

an
alternative
approach
is
to
classify
compounds
in
terms
of
the
seman
tic
relationship
between
the
compound
and
its
head
the
head
of
a
com
morphology
and
word
formationpound
is
the
constituent
modified
by
the
compound’s
other
constituents
in
english
heads
of
compounds
are
typically
the
rightmost
constituent
ex
cluding
any
derivational
and
inflectional
suffixes
for
example
in
traffic-cop
the
head
is
cop
which
is
modified
by
traffic
in
line-backer
the
head
is
backer
which
is
modified
by
line
linguists
distinguish
at
least
three
different
se
mantic
relations
between
the
head
and
modifier(s
of
compounds
first
the
compound
represents
a
subtype
of
whatever
the
head
repre
sents
for
instance
a
traffic-cop
is
a
kind
of
cop
a
teapot
is
a
kind
of
pot
a
fog-lamp
is
a
kind
of
lamp
a
blue-jay
is
a
kind
of
jay
that
is
the
head
names
the
type
and
the
compound
names
the
subtype
these
are
called
endocen
tric
compounds
second
the
compound
names
a
subtype
but
the
type
is
not
represented
by
either
the
head
or
the
modifier
in
the
compound
for
example
dead
head
redhead
and
pickpocket
represent
types
of
people
by
denoting
some
distinguishing
characteristic
there
is
typically
another
word
not
included
in
the
compound
that
represents
the
type
of
which
the
compound
repre
sents
the
subtype
in
the
case
of
deadhead
redhead
and
pickpocket
this
other
word
is
person
so
a
deadhead
is
a
person
who
is
an
enthusiastic
fan
of
the
band
the
grateful
dead
these
are
called
exocentric
compounds
third
there
are
compounds
in
which
both
elements
are
heads
each
con
tributes
equally
to
the
meaning
of
the
whole
and
neither
is
subordinate
to
the
other
for
instance
bitter-sweet
compounds
like
these
can
be
para
phrased
as
both
x
and
y
e.g
bitter
and
sweet
other
examples
include
teacher-researcher
and
producer-director
these
can
be
called
coordinative
compounds

each
set

the

the
language
are
restricted
to
uses
in
certain
fields
disciplines
professions
or
activities
i.e
registers
for
example
the
word
phoneme
is
restricted
to
the
linguistic
domain
interestingly
some
words
may
be
used
in
several
domains
with
a
different
meaning
in
each
though
these
meanings
may
be
a
specific
version
of
a
more
general
meaning
for
ex
ample
the
word
morphology
is
used
in
linguistics
to
refer
to
the
study
of
the
internal
structure
of
words
and
their
derivational
relationships
in
botany
to
refer
to
the
forms
of
plants
in
geology
to
refer
to
rock
formations
the
general
abstract
meaning
underlying
these
specific
meanings
is
the
study
of
form
besides
words
that
may
be
used
in
almost
any
context
and
those
that
are
technical
or
discipline
specific
there
are
words
that
play
important
roles
in
academic
discourses
generally
for

and
its
related
forms

indicate
and
its

indicative
and
result
as
such
words
are
used
across
disciplines
generally
without
local
idiosyncrasies
of
meaning
they
are
important
words
for
english
learners
both
native
and
non-native
speakers
for
a
useful
overview
of
the
attempts
to
create

complex
words
those
composed
of
more
than
one
morpheme
are
not
merely
unstructured
sequences
of
morphemes
for
example
the
plural
s
suffix
on
dropouts
must
be
added
to
the
entire
compound
dropout
not
to
out
to
which
drop
is
then
added
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
plural
suffix
may
be
attached
to
nouns
but
not
to
verbs
or
particles
drop
and
out
constitute
a
noun
only
after
they
have
been
brought
together
in
the

we
can

to

these

let’s
consider
this

more
closely
the

able
attaches

to

adjectives
besides

we
have
the
adjectives
doable
manage
able

which
are
derived
from
the
verbs
read
do
manage
and

respectively
we

the

adjectives
meaning

they
are

this
morpheme

pronounced
nred
not

an

read
and

consequently

able

un

then
be

introduction
in
every
language
we
find
groups
of
words
that
share
grammatical
charac
teristics
these
groups
are
called
parts
of
speech
and
we
examine
them
in
this
chapter
and
the
next
though
many
writers
on
language
refer
to
the
eight
parts
of
speech
e.g
weaver
the
actual
number
of
parts
of
speech
we
need
to
recognize
in
a
language
is
determined
by
how
fine
grained
our
analysis
of
the
language
is—the
more
fine-grained
the
greater
the
number
of
parts
of
speech
that
will
be
distinguished
in
this
book
we
distinguish
nouns
verbs
adjectives
and
adverbs
the
major
parts
of
speech
and
pronouns
wh-words
articles
auxiliary
verbs
prepositions
intensifiers
conjunctions
and
particles
the
minor
parts
of
speech
every
literate
person
needs
at
least
a
minimal
understanding
of
parts
of
speech
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
such
commonplace
items
as
diction
aries
and
thesauruses
which
classify
words
according
to
their
parts
and
sub-parts
of
speech
for
example
the
american
heritage
dictionary
th
edition
p
xxxi
distinguishes
adjectives
adverbs

definite
ar
ticles
indefinite
articles
interjections
nouns
prepositions
pronouns
and

it
also

intransitive
and
auxiliary

and

teachers
need
to
know
about
parts
of
speech
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
and
teach
about
style
manuals
and
school
grammars
regardless
of
their
discipline
teachers
need
this
information
to
be
able
to
help
students
expand
the
contexts
in
which
they
can
effectively
communicate
a
part
of
speech
is
a
set
of
words
with
some
grammatical
characteristic(s
in
common
and
each
part
of
speech
differs
in
grammatical
characteristics
from
every
other
part
of
speech
e.g
nouns
have
different
properties
from
verbs
which
have
different
properties
from
adjectives
and
so
on
part
of
speech
analysis
depends
on
knowing
or
discovering
the
distinguishing
properties
of
the
various
word
sets
this
chapter
describes
several
kinds
of
properties
that
separate
the
major
parts
of
speech
from
each
other
and
de
delahunty
and
garvey
scribes
several
ways
in
which
to
identify
a
word’s
part
of
speech
the
major
parts
of
speech
nouns
verbs
adjectives
adverbs
the
major
parts
of
speech
contribute
the
major
content
to
a
message
and
hence
are
sometimes
called
content
words
as
opposed
to
other
parts
of
speech
known
as
function
or
structure
words
the
content
words
are
the
ones
that
we
see
in
newspaper
headlines
where
space
is
at
a
premium
and
they
are
the
words
we
tend
to
keep
in
text
messaging
where
costs
per
word
can
be
high
however
in
most
types
of
discourse
function
words
significantly
outnumber
content
words
we
begin
our
discussion
of
each
part
of
speech
by
examining
its
tradi
tional
definition
which
is
generally
either
semantic
or
functional
we
evalu
ate
the
traditional
treatment
and
suggest
more
effective
means
of
classify
ing
the
word
type
by
referring
to
its
formal
characteristics
these
include
a
word’s
potential
inflectional
morphology
its
actual
derivational
morphol
ogy
and
the
positions
in
phrases
and
clauses
in
which
it
may
occur
for
example
the
word
kingdom
is
a
noun
because
it
can
be
inflected
for
plural
kingdom
s
it
ends
in
the
noun
creating
suffix
dom
and
it
can
occur
after
the
the
kingdom
we
also
examine
some
of
the
major
functions
of
each
part
of
speech
each
section
concludes
with
a
discussion
of
subclasses
of
the
larger
class
nouns
t
raditionally
a
noun
is
defined
as
a
word
that
names
a
person
place
thing
or
idea
weaver
this
defines
the
noun
category
according
to
what
its
members
are
assumed
to
typically
denote
so
it
is
a
meaning-based
or
semantic
definition
occasionally
this
definition
gets
abbreviated
to
a
noun
is
a
person
place
or
thing
which
makes
no
sense
at
all
by
weaver’s
definition
madonna
pittsburgh
and
godzilla
are
all
nouns
which
is
cor
rect
so
the
definition
provides
a
useful
start
however
if
we
apply
it
pre
cisely
and
to
be
worth
keeping
definitions
should
be
precisely
applicable
then
the
word
desk
is
not
a
noun
because
it
denotes
not
a
thing
but
a
whole
class
of
things
most
nouns
are
like
desk
in
this
regard
peacock
denotes
not
a
peacock
but
all
the
peacocks
living
now
as
well
as
all
those
that
existed
before
all
those
that
will
ever
exist
and
all
the
peacocks
that
we
merely
imagine
if
we
want
to
refer
to
one
peacock
we
have
to
add
a
modifier
such
as
a—a
peacock
cf
a
desk
a
book
a
hard
drive
we
might
revise
our
defi
nition
to
take
such
nouns
into
account—“nouns
name
classes
of
persons
places
things
and
ideas
but
now
we
require
pittsburgh
to
refer
not
to
one
the
major
parts
of
speechpittsburgh
but
to
a
whole
set
of
them
which
doesn’t
seem
quite
right
so
there
is
something
right
about
saying
that
nouns
name
classes
of
things
but
there
also
seem
to
be
nouns
that
name
individual
things
the
nouns
that
name
classes
of
things
are
common
nouns
the
nouns
and
other
types
of
expression
that
name
individual
things
are
proper
nouns
printer
is
a
common
noun
denver
is
a
proper
noun
in
english
we
conventionally
capitalize
the
initial
letter
of
proper
nouns
a
common
noun
can
be
turned
into
a
proper
noun
in
which
case
it
should
be
capitalized
for
instance
we
have
a
friend
whose
dog’s
name
is
dog
similarly
we
can
distinguish
god
of
which
there
may
be
many
from
god
which
is
presumed
to
be
unique—at
least
in
some
contexts
proper
nouns
name
individual
things
but
these
things
are
many
and
var
ied
they
include
individual
people
madonna
individual
animals
lassie
individual
places
addis
ababa
individual
things
earth
we’ll
have
a
lot
more
to
say
about
proper
names
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
we’ve
said
that
common
nouns
name
classes
of
things
but
this
needs
development
certainly
books
are
things
but
is
grease
a
thing
thing
seems
to
us
to
denote
only
things
that
can
be
individuated
and
counted
thing
one
thing
two
one
potato
two
potatoes
and
so
on
but
grease
doesn’t
seem
to
allow
this
we
don’t
at
least
not
typically
say
two
greases
or
even
just
one
grease
grease
is
like
milk
and
information
and
lots
of
other
similar
words
in
that
it
seems
to
denote
stuff
physical
or
mental
rather
than
individual
things
so
we
might
revise
our
definition
of
noun
again
and
say
that
com
mon
nouns
name
classes
of
things
and
stuff
or
if
you
prefer
to
go
uptown
nouns
name
classes
of
entities
and
substances
we’ll
return
to
this
issue
be
low
when
we
distinguish
more
fully
between
count
and
non-count
nouns
unfortunately
characterizing
nouns
as
names
of
things
and
stuff
only
works
if
we
limit
our
interpretation
of
things
and
stuff
to
just
what
nouns
name
which
makes
it
utterly
circular
moreover
if
we
answer
yes
when
asked
whether
events
actions
states
characteristics
and
relationships
are
things
then
we
must
allow
that
verbs
adjectives
and
other
parts
of
speech
also
name
things
but
surely
that’s
a
bit
of
a
problem
because
verbs
have
traditionally
been
assumed
to
name
actions
and
states
of
being
adjectives
to
name
characteristics
and
prepositions
to
name
relationships
our
focus
on
the
typical
meanings
of
nouns
is
what
has
gotten
us
into
this
fix
so
we
must
look
at
other
characteristics
of
nouns
if
we
are
to
have
any
success
in
finding
ways
to
identify
them
we’ve
worked
through
the
definition
of
noun
as
thoroughly
as
we
did
because
we
take
definitions
seriously
we
think
they
should
be
accurate
remember
our
discussion
of
critical
thinking
in
our
introduction
to
this
delahunty
and
garvey
book
imagine
looking
up
the
word
dugong
in
a
dictionary
and
finding
it
defined
merely
as
a
kind
of
animal
such
a
definition
won’t
help
us
use
the
word
accurately
likewise
if
we
are
to
use
the
word
noun
accurately
then
we
need
to
define
it
accurately
we
need
accurate
definitions
of
parts
of
speech
to
allow
us
to
accurately
determine
which
categories
words
belong
to
and
this
is
important
because
a
word’s
part
of
speech
determines
whether
and
how
it
can
be
inflected
as
well
as
its
roles
in
phrases
and
sentences
we
want
our
definitions
to
provide
us
with
criteria
by
which
we
can
accurately
determine
the
part
of
speech
of
any
word
we
choose
to
examine
for
better
analyses
we
must
consider
the
forms
of
words
formal
characteristics
of
nouns
we
approach
the
classification
of
nouns
and
of
the
other
major
parts
of
speech
through
a
series
of
simple
formal
tests
however
because
no
single
test
will
always
lead
to
reliable
results
part-of-speech
identification
requires
multi
ple
criteria
and
tests
of
different
types
we
cannot
rely
on
a
single
test
because
our
tests
are
like
any
scientific
tests—sometimes
they
give
false
positive
results
e.g
they
tell
us
that
we
are
ill
when
we
aren’t
and
sometimes
false
negatives
e.g
they
tell
us
that
we
are
well
when
we
are
ill
this
is
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
each
part
of
speech
includes
many
sub-categories
each
of
which
has
slightly
different
properties
from
the
other
sub-categories
and
which
therefore
respond
somewhat
differently
to
our
tests
as
a
result
we
have
to
interpret
our
test
results
cautiously
we
say
that
a
word
belongs
to
a
particular
part
of
speech
to
the
extent
that
it
passes
the
various
tests
for
that
part
of

tional
suffixes
hint
look
up
several
of
them
in
a
large
dictionary
a
common
role
of
derivational
morphemes
in
a
language
is
to
change
words
of
one
part
of
speech
into
related
words
of
another
part
of
speech
thus
the
verb
tolerate
becomes
the
noun
toleration
likewise
the
verb
act
becomes
the
adjective
active
which
becomes
the
noun
activity
by
the
addition
of
their
respective
suffixes
sometimes
derivation
will
change
a
word
to
a
different
subclass
of
the
same
part
of
speech
with
a
different
though
related
mean
ing
for
example
the
suffix
hood
turns
the
noun
knight
into
the
noun
knighthood
just
as
dom
turns
the
noun
king
into
the
noun
kingdom
as
we

derivational
suffixes
are
less
useful
than

characteristics
of
nouns
nouns
have
two
main
functions
the
first
and
perhaps
less
important
one
is
that
of
modifier
of
other
nouns
e.g
metal
door
linguistics
class
the
more
dominant
function
is
that
of
being
the
head
of
a
noun
phrase
many
functions
traditionally
associated
with
nouns
e.g
subject
direct
and
in
direct
object
of
clauses
object
of
a
preposition
subject
and
object
comple
ment
are
really
the
functions
of
noun
phrases
hence
we
will
postpone
discussion
of
these
functions
to
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
subclasses
of
nouns
there
are
lots
of
different
kinds
of
nouns
and
in
spite
of
our
reservations
about
using
meaning
as
a
criterion
to
determine
parts
and
subparts
of
speech
we
will
use
aspects
of
meaning
to
distinguish
the
traditional
subclasses
of
nouns
but
we
will
back
up
the
semantic
distinctions
by
pointing
out
formal
patterns
that
correlate
with
them
in
fact
we
can
only
be
certain
that
meaning
distinctions
really
exist
in
the
language
if
they
correspond
to
distinct
formal
patterns
proper
nouns
as
we
have
seen
are
the
words
that
best
fit
the
traditional
definition
of
a
noun—i.e
a
word
that
names
a
person
place
or
thing
thus
your
personal
name
names
you
though
it
may
also
name
other
people
den
ver
names
the
capital
city
of
colorado
and
colorado
names
the
state
that
den
ver
is
the
capital
of—both
of
which
are
places
and
things
note
that
proper
nouns
are
spelled
with
an
initial
capital
letter
and
if
the
proper
name
consists
of
more
than
one
word
e.g
the
statue
of
liberty
then
all
the
major
words
are
spelled
with
initial
capitals
we
will
deal
with
complex
proper
names
like
this
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
some
texts
may
vary
in
their
treatment
of
nouns
for
example
mcbeth
sometimes
capitalizes
gay
and
sometimes
does
not
and
gee
distinguishes
discourse
from
discourse
common
nouns
name
classes
of
things
individual
physical
objects
are
the
most
straightforward
instances
of
things
and
the
words
that
name
classes
of
such
things
are
indeed
generally
nouns
e.g
book
names
the
class
of
books
and
hard
drive
names
the
class
of
hard
drives
nouns
that
name
classes
of
physical
things
are
called
concrete
nouns
other
examples
include
sneeze
floor
and
paper
not
all
things
are
physical
some
like
ideas
exist
only
in
our
minds
words
for
classes
of
things
that
exist
only
in
minds
e.g
goodness
truth
beauty
and
reason
are
called
abstract
nouns
abstract
nouns
tend
to
be
non-count
see
below
and
to
end
in
certain
derivational
suffixes
e.g
ness

ude
common
nouns
may
also
name

of

of
things
for
exam
delahunty
and
garvey

the
class
of
a
particular
type
of

of
soldiers
team
names
the
class
of
collections
of
people
gathered
together
for
some
common
purpose
nouns
that
name
classes
of
collections
are
called
collective
nouns
other
examples
include
army
and
congress
in
american
english
collective
nouns
normally
take
a
singular
verb
e.g
the
jury
is
out
while
in
british
english
they
take
a
plural
e.g
the
jury
are
out
the
american
variety
some
times
uses
the
plural
to
suggest
lack
of
unity
within
the
group
e.g
the
jury
are
divided
pronoun
substitutes
for
collectives
are
also
normally
singular
in
american
and
plural
in
british
english
an
important
subdivision
of
nouns
particularly
for
people
learning
eng
lish
as
a
second
language
is
between
count
and
non-count
also
called
mass
nouns
some
non-count
nouns
are
thought
of
as
representing
things
as
if
they
were
undifferentiated
masses
whose
parts
are
not
identified
as
discrete
units
rice

news
count
nouns
represent
entities
that
can
be

some
remarks
on
the
genitive
case
the
genitive
case
is
typically
indicated
by
the
suffix
’s
e.g
maria
’s
success
the
genitive
expression
modifies
a
following
noun
maria’s
modifies
success
its
spelling
is
generally
written
as
’s
the
book
’s
cover
if
the
expression
it
is
attached
to
is
singular
or
is
an
irregular
plural
the
children
’s
toys
and
ei
ther
just
an
apostrophe
if
the
expression
it’s
attached
to
ends
in
s
the
jones
’
house
though
editorial
practice
varies
on
this
and
some
editors
use
’s
the
jones’s
house
while
the
genitive
is
generally
spelled
as
’s
or
s’
there
are
some
specific
exceptions
several
of
the
personal
pronouns
as
we’ll
see
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
have
genitive
forms
ending
in
s
ours
yours
theirs
note
that
there
is
no
apostrophe
in
the
spelling
of
these
forms
this
is
par
ticularly
noteworthy
in
its
the
genitive
of
it
which
is
frequently
misspelled
as
it’s
this
error
is
due
to
two
factors
first
its
violates
the
general
pattern
of
spelling
the
genitive
with
an
apostrophe
though
it
is
consistent
with
the
sub-pattern
that
pronouns
do
not
include
the
apostrophe
second
its
may
be
confused
with
the
word
it’s
which
is
a
contraction
of
it
is
note
that
whose
without
the
apostrophe
is
the
genitive
of
the
pronoun
who
while
who’s
the
contraction
of
who
is
is
parallel
to
it’s
like
the
regular
plural
s
the
genitive
has
three
allomorphs
s
after
voiceless
segments
dick’s
z
after
voiced
segments
toni’s
tom’s
and
z
or
iz
after

francis’s
the
genitive
is
often
referred
to
as
the
possessive
case
however
the
geni
tive
denotes
far
more
than
just
possession
for
example
bill’s
in
bill’s
tv
show
is
in
the
genitive
but
besides
possessing
the
tv
show
bill
might
also
have
been
its
producer
director
star
gaffer
key-grip
fan
or
occasional
viewer
to
avoid
too
narrowly
characterizing
the
meaning
of
the
genitive
we
prefer
this
term
to
possessive
exercise
briefly
discuss
the
possible
meaning
relations
between
the
genitive
ex
pression
and
the
noun
it
modifies
in

the
major
parts
of
speech
the
genitive
case
has
generally
been
regarded
as
an
inflection
suffixed
to
nouns
and
pronouns
and
while
it
is
true
that
pronouns
may
take
the
genitive
inflection
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
noun
phrases
not
nouns
may
take
it
note
where
the
genitive
inflection
is
attached
in
oscar
’s
plays
humpty
dumpty
’s
fall
the
kid
’s
skateboard
the
kid
next
door
’s
dog
the
guy
you
broke
up
with
’s
car
unlike
the
plural
inflection
which
is
suffixed
to
the
head
noun
of
an
np
the
genitive
inflection
is
suffixed
to
the
end
of
the
np
although
s-genitives
occur
on
nearly
all
noun
phrases
sometimes
the
alternative
of-phrase
sounds
stylistically
more
natural
cf
the
cause
of
the
accident
vs
the
accident’s
cause
in
english
the
inflected
genitive
is
most
comfortable
with
animate
entities
verbs
verbs
can
be
subdivided
into
main
and
auxiliary
verbs
we
will
treat
the
various
types
of
auxiliaries
such
as
may
might
and
should
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
and
will
concentrate
here
on
main
verbs
i.e
those
which
may
occur
alone
in
a
clause
t
raditional
grammars
define
verbs
seman
tically
e.g
as
words
that
represent
activities
grow
kiss
freeze
run
and
states
of
being
be
have
resemble
states
are
unchanging
situations
while
activities
are
situations
in
which
change
occurs
activity
verbs
are
also
called
dynamic
verbs
though
the
terminology
is
far
from
consistent
state
verbs
typically
have
to
do
with
existence
and
static
relationships
just
as
nouns
denote
classes
of
entities
and
stuff
verbs
denote
classes
of
states
and
activities
as
with
most
meaning-based
definitions
this
one
is
a
tad
simplistic
for
instance
nouns
derived
from
verbs
through
zero
derivation
e.g
strike
kick
throw
maintain
their
sense
of
action
as
nouns
derived
from
verbs
by
derivational
affixing
do
e.g
action
likewise
verbs
derived
from
nouns—e.g
pot
as
in
to
pot
plants
may
appear
to
retain
some
of
the
entity-naming
sense
they
had
as
nouns
in
addition
students
occasionally
classify
certain
adjectives
as
verbs
especially
those
adjectives
that
suggest
activity
e.g
vigorous
playful
cruel
and
we’ve
had
a
student
who
classi
fied
the
preposition
as
as
a
verb
because
it
denoted
a
relationship
as
verbs
often
do
additionally
adjectives
and
other
types
of
expressions
may
name
states
cf
to
sleep
and
asleep
nonetheless
the
semantic
division
of
verbs
is
a
good
place
to
start
our
discussion
though
we’ll
refine
the
activity/state
division
in
the
exercises
in
this
section
as
we
noted
in
our
discussion
of
nouns
it
is
important
to
correlate
a
se
mantic
distinction
with
distinct
formal
patterns
the
distinction
between
ac
tivity
and
state
verbs
correlates
with
whether
or
not
a
verb
can
occur
in
the
progressive
aspect
activity
verbs
can
oscar
is
growing
tall
state
verbs
cannot
oscar

his
father
delahunty

exercise
using
the

for
each
of
the
fol
lowing

did
you
run

any
problems
how
did
you
solve
them
state
verbs
are
particularly
common
in
academic
writing
confirm
this
by
examining
a
selection
of
texts
from
that
genre
why
do
you
think
state
verbs
are
so
common
in
this
genre
we
saw
that
nouns
may
shift
between
subcategories
so
it
should
be
no
surprise
to
find
verbs
shifting
between
the
state
and
activity
subcategories
for
example
be
is
a
state
verb
in
oscar
is
weird
but
an
action
verb
in
oscar
is
being
weird
as
its
occurrence
in
the
progressive
shows
the
former
sentence
means
that
oscar
is
generally
or
characteristically
weird
the
latter
means
that
he
is
acting
weird
though
we
can
expect
him
to
snap
out
of
it
eventually
exercise
the
distinction
between
permanent
and
temporary
characteristics
is
an
important
one
compare
tigers
are
fierce
with
tigers
are
tired
the
former
sentence
is
grammatical
and
unremarkable
it
represents
a
gen
eral
characteristic
of
the
class
of
tigers
the
latter
sentence
is
odd
in
that
it
seems
to
attribute
a
characteristic
we
would
normally
assume
to
be
temporary
as
if
it
were
a
permanent
characteristic
of
tigers
in
gen
eral
the
permanent/temporary
distinction
is
exploited
in
dictionaries
look
up
tiger
and
four
other
words
in
a
dictionary
and
discuss
how
this
distinction
is
reflected
in
how
they
are
defined
for
students
who
know
spanish

individual
verbs
may
have
more
than

meaning
con
sequently
we
might
expect
one
meaning
of
a
verb
to
represent
an
activ
ity
and
another
meaning
of
the
verb
to
represent
a
state
smell
is
such
a
verb
the
sentence
john
is
smelling
the
roses
is
grammatical
in
the
progressive
the
major
parts
of
speechand
therefore
has
an
activity
interpretation
now
compare
the
roses
smell
musty
which
is
non-progressive
and
grammatical
with
the
roses
are
smell
ing
musty
which
is
progressive
but
ungrammatical
from
data
like
this
we
must
conclude
that
smell
also
allows
a
state
interpretation
there
are
many
more

and
we

a
distinction
related
to
change
of
state
is
between
telic
and
atelic
verbs
telic
verbs
represent
events
that
have
a
natural
end
point
the
accomplishment
of
some
purpose
or
a
change
of
state
e.g
make
evaporate
these
are
also
called
accomplishment
or
resultative
verbs
once
something
is
made
or
has
evaporated
the
making
and
evaporating
processes
must
stop
for
that
thing
as
with
change
of
state
verbs
telic
verbs
in
the
progressive
represent
processes
before
their
completion
the
water
is
evaporating
implies
that
the
water
has
not
yet
fully
evaporated
atelic
verbs
represent
events
as
having
no
natural
end-state
or
product
e.g
golf
as
in
the
ceos
are
golfing
a
verb
may
be
telic
on
some
occasions
e.g
the
children
are
playing
a
game
of
delahunty
and
garvey
chess
but
atelic
on
other
occasions
e.g
the
children
are
playing
for
each
of
the
following
sentences
decide
whether
it
represents
a
telic
or
an
atelic
situation
and
justify
your
decision
a
she
wrote
a
poem
b
she
writes
poetry
c
the
water
froze
d
the
water
is
freezing
e
the
plane
arrived
the
count
non-count
distinction
in
nouns
is
similar
to
the
telic
atelic
distinction
in
verbs
count
nouns
represent
classes
of
bounded
entities
telic
verbs
represent
classes
of
bounded
situations
non-count
nouns
represent
unbounded
classes
of
things
or
substances
atelic
verbs
represent
unbounded
classes
of
events
thus
a
piece
of
a
chair
is
not
a

but
a
piece
of

is

similarly
writing

you
derive
about

from
this
similarity

the
main
verbs

just

then
classify
each
main
verb
as

which
kind
of
verb
predominates
in
that
piece
of
text
can
you
divide
the
text
into

each
with
a
different
rhetorical
purpose
do
the
verbs
in
the
two
sections
differ
why
do
you
think
that
might
be
we
can
divide
the
category
of
activity
verbs
into
those
that
repre
sent
events
that
take
just
a
point
of
time
punctual
verbs
e.g
tap
and
those
that
take
a
period
of
time
durative
verbs
e.g
read
in
the
progressive
punctual
verbs
strongly
suggest
repeated
action
oscar
is
tapping
his
fingers
impatiently
describes
multiple
finger
taps
but
os
car
is
reading
strongly
suggests
a
single
continuous
episode
of
reading
put
each
of
the
following
verbs
into
the
progressive
then
determine
whether
the
resulting
expression
denotes
multiple
repeated
events
or
a
single
continuous
activity
punch

work
change
of
state
process
verbs
are
yet
another
subclass
of
activity
verb
as
their
name
suggests
they
describe
change
from
one
state
to
another
e.g
melt
if
something
melts
then
it
changes
from
a
solid
to
a
liquid
state
but
notice
how
such
verbs
are
interpreted
when
they
the
major
parts
of
speechare
in
the
simple
past
tense
the
ice
melted
describes
the
completed
change
and
in
the
progressive
aspect
the
ice
is/was
melting
describes
the
melting
in
progress
but
not
yet
complete
by
comparing
their
in
terpretations
in
the
past
tense
and
the
progressive
show
that
the
fol
lowing
verbs
are
also
change
of
state
verbs
freeze
evaporate
arrive
ignite
die
a
change
of
state
verb
simply
represents
some
entity
as
undergo
ing
or
having
undergone
a
change
from
one
state
to
another
however
sentences
may
also
include
information
on
what
caused
the
change
of
state
compare

the

tells

who
caused
the

to

the

not
let’s

on
the

remember
activity

generally
simple

may
confuse

to
use
formal

to
identify

formal
characteristics
of
verbs
we
must
first
distinguish
formally
between
main
verbs
and
auxiliary
verbs
the
main
verb
can
appear
by
itself
in
a
verb
phrase
an
auxiliary
verb
regu
larly
appears
only
before
a
main
verb
consider
sentence
the
building
collapsed
onto
the
streets
in
this
sentence
collapse
is
the
main
verb
it
cannot
be
removed
from
the
sentence
without
producing
an
ungrammatical
result
e.g
the
building
onto
the
streets
the
main
verb
will
always
be
the
farthest
to
the
right
in
any
the
major
parts
of
speechseries
of
english
verbs
e.g
the
building
may
have
collapsed
in
addition
auxiliaries
can
be
inverted
in
questions
e.g
will
the
building
collapse
while
main
verbs
cannot
e.g
collapsed
the
building
just
as
we
did
with
nouns
we
use
formal
analytic
tests
to
determine
which
words
are
verbs
english
verbs
potentially
allow
four
inflections

with
a

in
regular

spelled
and
pronounced
identically
to
the

we
symbolize
verbs
with
this
inflection
as
ven
it
normally
occurs
with
the
auxiliary
verb
have
to
create
the
perfect

or
with
forms
of

create
passive
sentences
for

may
also
be

formally
identical

provide
extensive

some
important
properties
of
verb
inflections
first
certain
inflections
sometimes
require
changes
in
the
spelling
of
the
root
e.g
tries
hitting
phonologically
these
words
follow
the
regular
patterns
noted
above
second
for
regular
verbs—e.g
start
clean
try—the
past
tense
and
ven-forms
are
identical
in
sound
and
spelling
irregular
verbs—those
which
for
historical
reasons
differ
from
the
general
pattern—display
a
variety
of
in
flectional
differences
but
almost
exclusively
in
the
ved
and
ven-forms
with
very
few
exceptions
e.g
is
has
does
vs
and
ving
forms
fit
the
general
pat
tern
moreover
some
irregular
verbs
such
as
bring
and
hit
follow
the
same
pattern
as
regular
ones
by
having
identical
ved
and
ven
forms
though
these
are
not
formed
by
adding
ed
besides
varying
among
themselves
in
the
for
mation
of
ved
and
ven
forms
irregular
verbs
sometimes
have
dialect
variants
for
instance
shrink
has
the
alternate
past
shrunk
although
shrank
resembles
the
historically
older
form
of
the
verb
shrunk
reflects
a
pressure
in
modern
english
to
make
irregulars
more
regular
especially
by
making
the
ved
and
ven
forms
identical
indeed
the
archaic
shrunken
is
used
now
only
as
an
ad
jective
e.g
shrunken
head
only
a
few
modern
english
verbs
such
as
broken
and
frozen
actually
still
use
en
for
the
past
participle
form
though
dialects
vary—british
english
uses
mown
as
past
participle
whereas
american
eng
lish
uses
mowed
finally
irregular
verbs
often
have
regional
and
social
variants
that
may
be
stigmatized
particularly
in
academic
settings
students
are
often
unfortunately
and
inaccurately
considered
slow
or
ignorant
if
they
use
dove
drunk
and
seen
as
the
past
tense
forms
of
dive
drink
and

issues

intuition
will
allow

native
english
speaking
student
to

the
principal
parts

for
instance
the

can

determined
by
placing
the

in
a
simple
sentence
beginning
with
the
word

e.g
yesterday
i

a
gallon

juice
the

can
be
obtained
by
placing
the
verb
in
a
simple
sentence

or

i

if
with
a
little

can

it

such

the
reason
for

is
that

we

the
test

the

to

adjectives
while
traditional
grammars
usually
define
nouns
and
verbs
semantically
they
delahunty
and
garvey
often
shift
to
functional
criteria
to
characterize
adjectives
a
typical
definition
of
adjective
is
a
word
that
modifies
a
noun
or
pronoun
occasionally
you
will
see
adjectives
defined
as
words
that
describe
nouns
which
makes
no
more
sense
than
saying
that
nouns
are
persons
places
and
things
if
adjec
tives
describe
anything
it
is
whatever
the
nouns
they
modify
denote
while
we
might
criticize
the
traditional
definition
for
changing
from
meaning
to
function
it
is
more
appropriate
to
determine
whether
it
leads
to
reasonably
successful
identification
of
adjectives
the
definition
holds
good
in
simple
cases
such
as
old
shoes
offensive
re
mark
and
matters
inconsequential
though
in
the
last
case
students
may
have
trouble
recognizing
the
second
word
rather
than
the
first
as
an
adjective
but
in
each
case
the
adjective
does
modify
a
noun
which
serves
as
the
head
of
the
phrase
however
words
that
are
clearly
not
adjectives
may
modify
nouns
for
instance
stone
in
stone
wall
is
by
formal
criteria
a
noun
and
not
an
adjec
tive
cf
stones
and
stone’s
likewise
the
in
the
wall
shows
none
of
the
formal
characteristics
of
adjectives
though
it
clearly
modifies
the
noun
wall
in
a
nutshell
the
fact
that
a
word
modifies
a
noun
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
call
it
an
adjective
the
traditional
functional
definition
suffers
also
because
it
claims
that
ad
jectives
may
modify
pronouns
clearly
an
adjective
cannot
modify
a
pronoun
in
any
of
the
examples
below
a
old
them
b
offensive
it
c
they
inconsequential
to
justify
the
inclusion
of
pronouns
grammarians
refer
to
a
different
use
of
adjectives
as
in
sentences
and
the
judge
was
late
she
was
ill
in
and
the
adjectives
late
and
ill
are
predicate
adjectives
or
subject
complements
but
the
use
of
these
separate
labels
suggests—correctly—that
such
uses
of
adjectives
are
really
not
instances
of
modification
at
all
but
rather
of
complementation
any
student
who
tries
to
relate
such
examples
to
clear
cases
of
modification
will
become
befuddled
notice
also
the
difference
in
the
meaning
of
late
in
and
in
the
late
judge
while
most
adjectives
can
occur
as
noun
modifiers
and
as
predicate
adjec
tives
there
are
some
that
are
specialized
for
only
one
of
these
two
roles

the

parts

only
predicatively

of
english
as
a
second
language
such
as
the
cam
bridge
international
dictionary
of
english
to
see
how
they
are
treated
there
clearly
adjectives
may
modify
nouns
but
because
the
ability
to
modify
a
noun
is
neither
a
necessary
nor
a
sufficient
basis
for
adjectivehood
we
must
augment
the
functional

add
one
further
formal
feature
of
adjectives
their
position
in
a
sentence
adjectives
occur
in
a
very
limited
set
of
positions
the
two
most
common
are
a
between
a
determiner
an
article
or

word
and
a
noun
and
b
after
a
linking
verb
i.e
of
the
be-become-seem
delahunty

type
we
will
discuss
the
words
that
function
as

using
these

we
can

analytic

a

if
it
can
occur
a
between

of
the
be-become-seem
class
these
tendencies
are
not
as
strong
as
the
earlier
analytic
tests
that
we
pro
posed
since
non-adjectives
can
appear
in
both
positions
however
they
may
support
the
tests
in
doubtful
cases

to
show
that
they
may

we
must
make
a
rather
important
distinction
here
between
gradable
and
non-gradable
adjectives
gradable
adjectives
are
those
that
can
be
inflected
for
comparative
and
superlative
and
modified
by
more
most
very
somewhat
and
similar
words

a

other
non
gradable
adjectives
include
absolute
atomic
electronic
entire
single
as
you
can
demonstrate
for
yourself
by
trying
to
inflect
or
modify
them
non-gradable
adjectives
may
over
time
become
gradable
and
this
process
may
cause
usage
controversy
as
the
recent
history
of
unique
shows
for
more
on
this
word
we
suggest
that
you
check
unique
in
a
dictionary
preferably
one
such
as
the
american
heritage
which
includes
thoughtful
usage
notes
our
final
test
for
adjectivehood
relies
on
the
fact
that
only
adjectives
can
occur
in
the
frame
as
as
a(n
x
where
x
is
an
appropriate
noun
for
example
in
as
fearless
as
a
lion
fearless
is
in
the
test
position
and
lion
is
a
noun
filling
the
x
position
because
the
expression
is
grammatical
we
can
infer
that
fearless
may
be
an
adjective
exercise
apply
the
test
frame
as
as
a(n

of

are

a
confusion
of

however
for
purposes
of
completeness
we

these
distinctions
here

the

elsewhere

satisfy

group
is
sometimes

vided
into

from

section
we
have
tried
to
justify
their

traditional
subclasses
of

to
classify
such
a
disparate
group
of
structures
as

destroys
the
possibility
of
any
consistent
system
of
parts
of

in
our
approach
none

exist

adverbs
the
traditional
definition
of
adverb
is
a
word
used
to
modify
a
verb
an
ad
jective
or
another
adverb
this
definition
is
clearly
functional
and
actually
represents
the
typical
functions
of
adverbs
or
at
least
adverb
phrases

well
e.g

adroit

above
omits
an
important
function
of
adverbs
namely
mod

complete
sentence
as
in
b
d
and
f
in
the
exercise
just
above
and
in
frankly
i
don’t
like
calamari
here
the
adverb
frankly
indicates
that
the
speaker
feels
he
or
she
is
being
candid
in
uttering
the
sentence
and
as
we
have
now
grown
to
expect
from
functional
definitions
the
traditional
definition
of
adverb
will
predict
false
positives
i.e
predict
that
certain
words
or
expressions
are
adverbs
when
they
are
not
for
instance
compare
cautiously
with
with
caution
in
the
officer
approached
the
motorist
cautiously/with
caution
both
expressions
function
identically—both
tell
us
the
manner
in
which
the
officer
approached
the
motorist
i.e
both
mod
ify
the
verb
approached
however
while
cautiously
is
definitely
an
adverb
with
caution
is
just
as
definitely
a
prepositional
phrase
we
will
formally
distinguish
true
adverbs
from
other
phrases
that
can
fulfill
some
of
the
same
functions
as
adverbs
but
we
will
refer
to
all
expressions
that
function
like
adverbs
with
the
cover-term
adverbial
our
approach
as
usual
will
be
to
begin
with
a
formal
characterization
of
adverbs
we
will
then
return
for
a
brief
review
of
the
functional
division
of
adverbs
according
to
what
they
modify—sentences
verbs
verb
phrases
adjectives
and
adverbs
finally
we
will
indicate
some
of
the
traditional
se
mantic
categories
of
adverbs
formal
characteristics
of
adverbs
many
adverbs
cannot
be
inflected
but
those
that
can
are
indistinguish

in
that

from

we
can
minimally

appendix
to
major
parts
of
speech
prototypes
perhaps
the
greatest
frustration
for
students—and
teachers—of
grammar
is
the
discovery
that
seemingly
clear
and
airtight
definitions
and
tests
fail
to
work
smoothly
in
all
cases
we
argued
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
that
one
source
of
this
difficulty
is
the
faulty
status
of
definitions
for
instance
those
that
determine
parts
of
speech
on
the
basis
of
their
meanings
or
functions
our
system
augments
such
definitions
with
a
set
of
formal
conditions
pertaining
to
morphological
inflectional
and
derivational
and
syntactic
positional
characteristics
of
words
as
some
of
our
exercises
dem
onstrate
not
all
conditions
will
apply
in
all
cases
for
instance
the
condi
tion
that
nouns
can
be
made
plural
might
seem
to
exclude
many
words
that
are
clearly
nouns
by
other
criteria
e.g
cattle
and
furniture
on
the
other
hand
these
words
can
accept
the
genitive
as
in
the
cattle’s
thirst
and
the
furniture’s
delivery
additionally
the
ure
morpheme
on
furniture
is
typical
to
nouns
armature
ligature
caricature
and
signature
though
other
words
besides
nouns
may
appear
to
end
in
the
ure
morpheme
mature
adjective
or
verb
and
insure
verb
in
other
words
we
seem
to
find
cases
where
our
delahunty
and
garvey
conditions
a
fail
to
apply
to
all
members
of
a
parts-of-speech
class
and
b
seem
to
apply
to
words
outside
the
class
that
the
conditions
are
chosen
to
identify
t
wo
natural
reactions
to
this
situation
are
possible
one
response
would
simply
be
to
ignore
the
anomalies
and
present
the
conditions
as
absolutes
this
approach
requires
that
conditions
be
both
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
are
necessary
if
they
all
have
to
apply
they
are
sufficient
if
no
other
conditions
are
needed
this
approach
has
the
serious
disadvantage
of
colliding
head-on
with
reality
a
second
response
would
give
up
the
entire
enterprise
of
defining
parts
of
speech
as
too
haphazard
to
be
worth
doing
but
if
we
adopt
this
course
of
action
we
will
never
learn
anything
about
language
and
our
students
will
wrongly
assume
that
it
is
utterly
chaotic
as
you
might
suspect
we
view
both
of
these
extreme
positions
as
funda
mentally
wrong—wrong
about
the
nature
of
language
and
wrong
about
the
way
in
which
language
should
be
studied
let
us
now
examine
why
let’s
begin
with
two
exercises
or
party
games
if
you
prefer
first
ask
a
group
of
your
friends
to
make
a
list
of
ten
birds
if
you
tally
your
lists
of
birds
you
will
find
that
certain
names
appear
early
on
many
lists
e.g
eagle
robin
sparrow
while
others
appear
later
e.g
owl
crow
also
some
names
will
appear
on
almost
all
lists
while
others
e.g
chicken
penguin
ostrich
will
appear
less
frequently
or
not
at
all
the
next
step
is
to
ask
your
subjects
why
they
made
their
choices
they
will
probably
say
that
birds
have
feathers
lay
eggs
and
are
able
to
fly
and
in
the
clearest
cases
all
these
conditions
apply
however
in
less
clear
cases
some
but
not
all
of
the
conditions
apply
or
the
conditions
conflict
for
ex
ample
robins
have
feathers
fly
and
lay
eggs
while
chickens
typically
do
not
fly
or
at
least
do
not
fly
very
far
penguins
and
ostriches
do
not
fly
at
all
while
our
experiment
tells
us
about
how
we
categorize
actual
birds
it
also
tells
us
about
how
we
use
the
word
bird
when
we
use
an
expression
like
bird
we
group
together
objects
not
so
much
on
the
basis
of
a
rigid
set
of
characteristics
but
on
a
set
of
criteria
or
conditions
that
we
use
flexibly
in
this
way
we
group
together
objects
on
the
basis
of
what
the
philosopher
ludwig
wittgenstein
called
family
resemblances
you
might
envision
then
a
target
with
some
objects
close
to
the
bull’s
eye—those
entities
that
are
clearly
birds
those
entities
that
fall
closest
to
the
center
of
the
target
are
called
prototypes
they
possess
all
of
the
features
typical
of
the
category
toward
the
periphery
of
the
target
lie
entities
that
are
less
birdy
according
to
how
many
of
the
conditions
they
meet
in
language
also
the
boundaries
between
classes
of
words
may
be
fuzzy
that
is
just
as
we
may
occasionally
the
major
parts
of
speechhave
trouble
deciding
whether
to
call
a
particular
creature
a
bird
e.g
is
archaeopteryx
a
bird
we
may
also
have
difficulty
deciding
whether
a
word
is
a
noun
or
an
adjective
e.g
poor
see
figure
in
aitchison
of
course
not
all
conditions
are
of
equal
importance
some
are
essen
tial
their
lack
disqualifies
something
as
being
an
instance
of
a
category
for
instance
a
bird
must
lay
eggs
rather
than

at
the
other
extreme
some
conditions
are
excluded
they
must
not
be
present
a
bird
cannot
have
four
legs
between
these
extremes
lie
other
conditions
ex
pected
conditions
are
associated
with
normal
or
typical
characteristics
such
as
flight
for
birds
creatures
that
lack
an
expected
feature—e.g
penguins
which
cannot
fly—may
serve
to
make
the
object
an
atypical
or
defective
member
of
its
class
without
disqualifying
it
from
membership
altogether
some
conditions
are
merely
possible
they
result
from
common
associa
tions
of
the
object
for
example
birds
commonly
eat
worms
yet
one
would
hardly
be
surprised
at
a
bird
that
ate
only
seeds
finally
certain
conditions
are
unlikely
though
not
strictly
impossible
a
pound
animal
that
met
all
the
essential
bird
criteria
might
strain
the
imagination
but
we
would
probably
be
willing
to
categorize
it
as
a
bird
cruse
we
thus
seem
to
identify
objects
on
the
basis
of
their
resemblance
to
certain
prototypes—an
object
which
we
consider
the
most
typical
member
of
the
category
in
other
words
prototypes
share
all
of
the
necessary
and
expected
conditions
perhaps
some
of
the
possible
ones
and
none
of
the
excluded
or
unlikely
ones
how
does
the
notion
of
prototypes
relate
to
grammar
well
labels
such
as
noun
and
verb
have
much
the
same
status
as
bird
we
can
state
a
set
of
conditions—inflectional
derivational
and
syntactic—that
allow
us
to
classify
words
in
a
relatively
consistent
and
logical
fashion
however
cases
arise
when
not
all
of
the
conditions
apply
that
is
certain
nouns
may
be
less
nouny
than
others
nevertheless
nouns
demonstrate
a
family
resemblance
to
one
another
because
they
share
many
characteristics
of
course
you
can
expect
to
encounter
words
that
cause
difficulties
since
the
borders
of
the
noun
category
are
fuzzy
for
instance
consider
the
following
words
that
end
in
ing
interest
ing
meeting
sing
singing
let
us
consider
the
condition
of
taking
the
plural
morpheme
along
with
the
related
feature
of
appearing
in
the
noun
slot
two
we
can
thus
immediately
eliminate
interesting
two
interestings
and
perhaps
sing
two
sings
unless
we
are
native
americans
we
can
immediately
qualify
meeting
as
a
noun
two
meetings
singing
raises
some
problems
is
two
singings
grammatical
speakers
will
vary
in
how
they
answer
this
question
indicating
that
the
expression
lies
on
the
border
of
the
noun
category
note
however
that
the
variation
has
no
impact
on
the
force
of
the
conditions
even
delahunty
and
garvey
someone
who
accepts
the
phrase
as
grammatical
will
readily
agree
that
it
is
not
a
typical
use
of
the
word
singing
thus
we
might
conclude
that
the
capacity
to
be
made
plural
is
an
expected—though
not
essential—condition
for
nouns
you
might
object
that
the
notion
of
prototypes
leads
to
linguistic
anar
chy
perhaps
there
are
no
essential
conditions
moreover
if
standards
are
flexible
aren’t
we
in
danger
of
measuring
with
a
rubber
ruler
this
reaction
however
initially
reasonable
has
no
real
justification
in
fact
our
position
allows
the
maintenance
of
analytic
standards
without
reducing
grammar
either
to
legalistic
rigidity
or
anarchic
mush
for
one
thing
english
itself
is
grammatically
flexible
the
prevalence
of
conversion
from
one
part
of
speech
to
another
with
no
formal
change
provides
one
clear
example
english
allows
almost
any
word
to
be
converted
to
another
part
of
speech
at
least
in
restricted
contexts
as
the
following
sug
gest
a
ifs
ands
or
buts
subordinating
and
coordinating
conjunc
tions
to
nouns
b
whys
and
wherefores
interrogatives
to
nouns
c
but
me
no
buts
coordinator
to
verb
and
noun
what
we
see
here
are
instances
of
linguistic
creativity
the
ability
to
make
infinite
use
of
finite
linguistic
resources
which
as
we’ve
seen
is
characteristic
of
all
languages
clearly
the
concepts
we
use
to
describe
language
should
be
able
to
account
for
the
linguistic
characteristics
we
actually
observe
categories
arranged
around
prototypes
and
which
allow
fuzzy
boundaries
allow
us
to
do
this
such
categories
do
not
require
that
we
abandon
our
standards
of
linguistic
usage
rather
they
should
encour
age
us
to
study
and
understand
the
language
as
it
is
used
not
merely
judge
it
on
the
basis
of
simplistic
a
priori
assumptions
lest
this
sound
too
abstract
let’s
consider
some
practical
consequences
of
the
fact
that
not
all
criteria
apply
to
every
word
in
a
class
one
consequence
is
that
we
must
accept
that
all
major
classes
of
words
consist
of
subclasses
of
those
words
e.g
those
nouns
that
cannot
be
made
plural
e.g
information
independence
some
of
the
nouns
that
cannot
be
made
plural
constitute
the
subclass
of
non-count
mass
nouns
though
there
are
many
other
subclasses
of
nouns
of
which
we’ve
seen
a
few
teachers
should
be
knowledgeable
about
the
most
important
subclasses
of
words
and
their
linguistic
proper
ties
e.g
count
and
non-count
nouns
transitive
and
intransitive
verbs
and
so
on
and
be
able
to
accurately
present
them
to
their
students
especially
to
those
students
whose
first
language
is
not
english
the
major
parts
of
speech
a
second
consequence
of
prototypes
is
that
they
allow
us
to
see
similari
ties
between
classes
of
words
for
instance
they
encourage
us
to
ask
ques
tions
such
as
how
is
a
noun
like
a
verb
this
question
may
seem
like
a
riddle
but
if
we
consider
the
two
subclasses
of
verbs—transitive
and
intransitive
on
the
formal
basis
that
the
former
but
not
the
latter
may
take
an
object
as
in
a,b
a
the
broncos
defeated
the
jets
b
the
rabbit
disappeared
in
a
defeat
is
inflected
for
past
tense
and
so
is
clearly
a
verb
and
because
it
is
followed
by
the
direct
object
the
jets
it
is
transitive
in
b
disappeared
is
likewise
a
verb
but
it
is
intransitive
since
it
cannot
be
followed
by
a
direct
object
as
a,b
show
a
the
rabbit
disappeared
itself
i.e
made
itself
disappear
b
the
magician
disappeared
the
rabbit
corresponding
to
the
verbs
in
are
nouns
that
resemble
them
a
the
broncos’
defeat
of
the
jets
b
the
rabbit’s
disappearance
note
that
example
a
contains
the
noun
defeat
it
can
be
made
plural
which
has
been
converted
from
a
verb
and
which
is
modified
by
the
geni
tive
phrase
the
broncos’
which
corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
verb
defeat
in
a
while
the
prepositional
phrase
of
the
jets
corresponds
to
the
direct
object
the
jets
in
a
likewise
the
derived
noun
disappearance
in
b
cor
responds
to
the
verb
disappear
in
b
however
just
as
the
verb
disappear
cannot
accept
an
object
the
noun
disappearance
cannot
take
an
of-phrase
complement
corresponding
to
a
direct
object
as
shown
by
the
ungrammati
cality
of
a,b
compare
to
a,b
a
the
rabbit’s
disappearance
of
itself
b
the
magician’s
disappearance
of
the
rabbit
in
other
words
certain
nouns
have
restrictions
that
closely
parallel
those
of
transitivity
on
verbs
the
facts
of
english
grammar
thus
suggest
that
the
rigid
separation
of
parts
of
speech
conceals
a
potentially
rich
network
of
similarities
among
delahunty
and
garvey
categories
similarities
that
might
prove
interesting
for
teachers
of
writing
a
prototype
approach
encourages
one
to
explore
rather
than
ignore
possible
connections
between
categories
references
and
resources

more

approach
in
the
previous
chapter
used
formal
criteria
to
try
to
arrive
at
consistent
assignments
of
words
to
parts
of
speech
our
approach
in
this
chapter
will
be
similar
the
minor
word
classes
are
often
referred
to
as
closed
classes
this
is
because
they
have
relatively
few
members
which
are
added
to
only
occa
sionally
as
a
result
some
of
the
minor
form
classes
can
be
defined
simply
by
listing
their
members
we
will
distinguish
about
a
dozen
of
these
classes
but
the
largest
of
them
the
prepositions
has
only
about
members
na
tive
english-speaking
students
do
not
need
to
memorize
the
members
of
these
classes
they
can
become
as
consciously
familiar
as
they
need
to
be
with
them
through
presentation
and
practice
some
memorization
may
help
some
non-native
english
speaking
students
but
again
proper
presentation
and
lots
of
practice
should
enable
them
to
develop
control
over
these
words
minor
word
classes
have
several
properties
in
common
first
they
tend
not
to
alter
the
basic
content
of
a
sentence
for
this
reason
they
have
some
times
been
called
function
or
grammatical
words
in
contrast
to
the
major
parts
of
speech
called
content
words
content
words
bear
the
main
se
mantic
burden
in
communication
they
are
the

that
you
would

to

minor

signal

and
interactional
aspects
of

the

omitted
from

words
members

the

word

more
frequently

mem
delahunty

garvey
bers
of
major
classes
all
of
the
most
common
words
in
english
are
function
words
they
account
for
about
of
words
used
in
speech
and
of
those
used
in
writing
you
can
check
this
for
yourself
by
count
ing
the
words
in
this
paragraph
then
counting
the
words
belonging
to
the
major
parts
of
speech
and
subtracting
that
number
from
the
whole
the
remainder
is
the
number
of
words
belonging
to
the
minor
parts
of
speech
though
sometimes
used
to
dramatize
the
sorry
state
of
english
this
statistic
is
as
true
of
henry
james’
prose
as
of
the
most
pedestrian
discourse
this
is
because
the
minor
words
are
essential
for
indicating
important
modifica
tions
to
and
relations
among
the
content
words
regardless
of
whether
the
content
words
were
chosen
by
the
brilliant
or
the
dull
because
they
are
important
for
integrating
content
words
into
the
structural
organization
of
sentences
minor
class
words
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
structure
words
in
presenting
the
minor
word
classes
we
will
proceed
mainly
by
list
ing
some
or
all
of
their
members
we
will
also
note
semantic
functional
and
formal
characteristics
except
for
pronouns
the
formal
properties
of
these
items
do
not
in
english
include
inflectional
or
derivational
marking
rather
they
emerge
from
the
item’s
ability
to
combine
with
other
words
phrases
or
sentences
for
instance
after
is
a
preposition
because
it
can
com
bine
with
a
noun
phrase
bolded
as
in
after
the
announcement
the
com
bination
of
a
preposition
and
its
following
noun
phrase
is
called
a
prepo
sitional
phrase
we
will
examine
this
and
other
phrases
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
since
minor
class
members
may
enter
into
several
different
types
of
combination
they
will
sometimes
like
content
words
be
members
of
more
than
one
class
for
example
when
after
is
followed
by
a
clause
as
in
after
the
announcement
appeared
we
received
many
phone
calls
it
is
traditionally
thought
of
as
a
subordinating
adverbial
conjunction
pronouns
the
traditional
definition
of
pronoun
is
a
word
used
in
place
of
one
or
more
nouns
let’s
test
the
adequacy
of
this
definition
by
examining
some
examples
a
jonathan
felt
sorry
for
jeremy
so
he
repaired
his
bike
for
him
b
because
he
wanted
to
sell
it
jonathan
repaired
his
bike
c
jonathan
repaired
his
bike
the
traditional
definition
is
a
formal
one
you
can
easily
test
it
by
replacing
each
one
of
the
pronouns
with
either
of
the
nouns
jonathan
or
jeremy
in
a-c
while
the
replacement
definition
of
pronouns
seems
to
work
well
enough
the
minor
parts
of
speechfor
a-c
ask
yourself
what
their
replaces
in
sentence
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
elected
juan
as
their
representative
clearly
if
it
replaces
anything
it
replaces
a
version
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
which
is
very
definitely
not
a
noun
or
mere
list
of
nouns
in
fact
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
is
a
noun
phrase
a
group
of
words
that
has
a
noun
in
this
case
members
as
its
head
word
sentences
like
and
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
them
show
that
the
standard
definition
of
a
pronoun
must
be
amended
at
least
to
read
a
noun
or
noun
phrase
but
even
this
reformulation
is
not
accurate
if
we
replace
the
noun
members
in
sentence
with
a
pronoun
it
becomes
ungrammatical
all
of
the
them
of
the
class
elected
juan
as
their
representative
a
pronoun
replaces
a
noun
only
when
that
noun
is
the
only
word
and
there
fore
the
head
in
its
phrase
we
must
conclude
that
pronouns
always
replace
entire
noun
phrases
for
the
moment
let’s
define
a
pronoun
as
a
word
that
replaces
a
noun
phrase
any
discussion
of
pronouns
must
address
the
issue
of
how
we
decide
what
a
particular
pronoun
refers
to
in
a
specific
sentence
for
example
one
very
likely
interpretation
of
c
is
jonathan
repaired
jonathan’s
bike
on
this
inter
pretation
his
is
assumed
to
refer
to
whoever
jonathan
refers
to
presumably
jonathan
because
a
pronoun
and
its
antecedent
refer
to
the
same
entity
in
the
discourse
world
they
are
said
to
co-refer
so
the
noun
phrase
jonathan
is
used
to
determine
the
referent
of
his
a
noun
phrase
that
determines
the
ref
erent
of
a
pronoun
is
said
to
be
that
pronoun’s
antecedent
this
term
used
to
mean
going
before
and
in
most
cases
a
pronoun’s
antecedent
does
precede
the
pronoun
though
sentence
b
shows
that
an
antecedent
can
sometimes
follow
its
pronoun
however
sentences
a-c
are
systematically
ambiguous
they
can
mean
either
d-f
or
g-i
respectively
d
jonathan
felt
sorry
for
jeremy
so
jonathan
repaired
jeremy’s
bike
for
jeremy
e
because
jonathan
wanted
to
sell
it
jonathan
repaired
jonathan’s
bike
f
jonathan
repaired
jonathan’s
bike
g
jonathan
felt
sorry
for
some
person
so
jonathan
repaired
that
person’s
bike
for
that
person
delahunty
and
garvey
h
because
some
person
wanted
to
sell
it
jonathan
repaired
that
per
son’s
bike
i
jonathan
repaired
some
person’s
bike
that
is
what
a
pronoun
refers
to
is
not
always
determined
by
another
noun
phrase
in
its
sentence
rather
what
a
pronoun
refers
to
may
be
determined
by
the
situational
context
in
which
the
language
is
used
as
is
typically
the
case
in
spoken
interaction
we’d
like
you
to
notice
now
that
pronouns
are
typically
shorter
and
communicate
far
less
information
than
their
antecedents
for
example
their
in
provides
only
the
information
that
more
than
one
entity
is
being
referred
to
along
with
the
grammatical
information
that
their
is
in
the
genitive
case
clearly
far
less
information
than
its
antecedent
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
provides
using
pronouns
instead
of
full
noun
phrases
avoids
repetition
and
reduces
the
production
demands
on
the
speaker
or
writer
and
processing
demands
on
hearers
or
readers
however
because
pronouns
provide
so
little
information
hearers/readers
expect
that
speakers/writers
will
use
them
only
when
it
is
easy
to
determine
what
they
refer
to
if
a
pronoun’s
referent
is
not
easily
or
unambiguously
de
termined
hearers/readers
may
quickly
give
up
trying
to
interpret
the
piece
of
discourse
in
which
it
occurs
in
face-to
face
communication
the
hearer
can
simply
ask
the
speaker
to
clarify
an
unclear
reference
but
in
written
communication
this
is
typically
not
possible
because
confusion
in
spoken
language
can
be
fairly
readily
clarified
it
tends
to
have
more
pronouns
than
written
language
beginning
writers
and
sometimes
even
more
advanced
ones
often
use
pronoun
patterns
typical
of
spoken
language
and
so

definitions
of

that

are
fundamentally
flawed
we
prefer
a
more
general
definition
a
pronoun
is
a
minimal
linguistic
form
which
refers
to
speaker(s
addressee(s
and
other(s
and
provides
such
grammatical
information
as
person
number
gender
case
and
humanness
these
minimal
forms
reduce
the
effort
required
in
speaking
and
writing
by
eliminating
the
need
to
repeat
longer
expressions
when
we
wish
to
refer
to
someone
or
something
more
than
once
for
second
and
subsequent
refer
ences
we
select
just
enough
information
to
allow
our
audience
to
keep
track
of
what
we’re
speaking
or
writing
about
if
we
choose
to
use
pronouns
because
the
information
they
communicate
is
so
minimal
we
must
use
them
only
when
the
information
they
communicate
is
sufficient
to
allow
an
audience
to
easily
figure
out
what
they
refer
to
either
from
the
co-text
or
from
the
situational
context
the
grammatical
agreement
expected
between
a
pronoun
and
its
antecedent
is
crucial
for
making
the
pronoun’s
reference
clear

hint
at
the
morphological

of
the
language
a
millennium
ago
for
instance
old
english
had
pronouns
that
referred
specifically
to
two
people
called
dual
pronouns
thereby
creating
a
three-way
number
distinction
we
still
have
the
word
both
to
refer
to
two
entities
and
either
neither
to
refer
to
a
choice
between

standard
english
is
unusual
among
languages
in
that
it
makes
no
distinc

in
the
personal

between
second
person
singular
and
plural
you
does
for
both
many
non-standard
dialects
of
english
do
differentiate

by
adding

nominal

or
by
adding
all

tu

this
distinction
does
double
duty
it
can
indicate
not
only
the
person

num
ber
distinction
but
also
certain
aspects
of
the
relationship
between
a
speaker
and
addressee(s
most
notably
their
relative
social
statuses
and
the
degree
of
intimacy
between
them
thus
while
the
french
singular
pronoun
tu
may
be
used
by
an
adult
to
a
child
the
child
would
normally
use
vous
to
the

tu
can
be
used
between

be
used
among
people
who
are

the

in

pe
riods

thou

thee
thy

were
used

while

the

have
been
extensively

which
we

the

of

english
masculine
and
feminine
pronouns
come
in
three
different
forms
he
him
his
she
her
hers
these
different
forms
are
said
to
represent
different
cases
of
the
pronouns
which
case
of
a
pronoun
to
use
depends
upon
the
relation
of
that
word
to
other
parts
of
the
sentence
we
use
he
and
she
when
the
pronoun
is
the
subject
of
a
sentence
him
and
her
if
it
is
the
object
of
a
verb
or
a
preposition
and
his
and
her
if
the
pronoun
modifies
a
noun
we
will
use
the
traditional
names
to
refer
to
these
cases
he/she
are
in
the
nomi
native
case
him/her
are
in
the
objective
a.k.a
accusative
case
and
his/her
are
in
the
genitive
english
also
differentiates
other
pronouns
according
to
case
thus
i
you
we
they
are
all
nominative
me
you
us
them
are
all
objective
and
my
mine
your
yours
our
ours
their
theirs
are
all
genitive
delahunty
and
garvey
you
will
no
doubt
have
noticed
that
there
are
two
genitive
forms
of
cer
tain
pronouns
such
as
my
and
mine
the
forms
corresponding
to
my
your
our
their
are
used
when
they
directly
modify
a
noun
otherwise
we
use
the
other
genitive
forms
that
is
my
horse
as
opposed
to
that
horse
is
mine
the
former
are
sometimes
misleadingly
referred
to
as
possessive
adjectives
as
they
occur
before
the
nouns
they
modify
in
the
positions
believed
wrongly
to
be
typical
of
attributive
adjectives
the
latter
are
often
distinguished
as
possessive
pronouns
because
they
appear
to
replace
possessive
nouns
or
noun
phrases
e.g
compare
that
bike
is
hers
with
that
bike
is
kelly’s
english
nouns
functioning
as
heads
of
subjects
do
not
differ
in
form
from
nouns
functioning
as
heads
of
objects
so
we
do
not
distinguish
between
nominative
and
objective
cases
in
those
instances
grammarians
occasion
ally
refer
to
the
nominative/objective
form
of
nouns
as
the
common
case
earlier
forms
of
english
the
classical
languages
latin
and
greek
and
modern
languages

as

gender

the

system
of
english
distinguishes
three
genders
masculine
forms
of
he
feminine
forms
of
she
and
neuter
not
neutral
forms
of
it
distinguished
primarily
according

primarily
human
males
feminine
pronouns
refer
to
females
primarily
human
females
and
neuter
pronouns
refer
either
to
non-human
animals
or
to
entities
that
are
non-animate
and
consequently
are
not
differentiated
according
to
sex
infants
whose
sex
is
the
minor
parts
of
speechunknown
are
also
occasionally
referred
to
by
neuter
pronouns
a
system
in
which
the
gender
of
a
word
depends
upon
characteristics
of
its
referent
is
called
a
natural
gender
system
other
languages
such
as
french
german
italian
spanish
and
gaelic
have
grammatical
gender
systems
the
choice
of
gender
is
not
dependent
upon
characteristics
of
a
word’s
referent
rather
words
may
be
assigned
to
gender
classes
often
according
to
formal
linguistic
criteria
in
italian
and
spanish
for
example
words
ending
in
a
are
typically
feminine
in
ger
man
words
ending
in
chen
are
typically
neuter
however
many
nouns
in
these
languages
are
assigned
to
gender
classes
somewhat
arbitrarily
and
so
when
learning
a
noun
one
must
also
learn
its
gender
also
in
these
lan
guages
the
gender
system
is
reflected
not
only
in
the
pronouns
and
nouns
but
in
adjectives
and
articles
too
in
spanish
a
noun
and
any
article
or
adjective
modifying
it
must
agree
in
gender
if
the
noun
is
masculine
then
any
associated
article
or
adjective
must
be
masculine
e.g
el
libro
blanco
lit
the
book
white
the
white
book
if
the
noun
is
feminine
its
modi
fiers
must
also
be
feminine
e.g
la
casa
blanca
lit
the
house
white
the
white

in
recent
years
the
english
gender
system
has
given
rise
to
much
discus
sion
of
the
issue
of
sexism
in
language
and
the
need
to
develop
forms
that
are
sex-neutral
standard
written
english
makes
it
difficult
not
to
refer
to
the
sex
of
a
human
referent
when
choosing
a
personal
pronoun
regardless
of
whether
the
person’s
sex
is
relevant
or
even
known
or
knowable
for
ex
ample
compare
the
sentences
every
doctor
works
hard
for
her
patients
and
every
doctor
works
hard
for
his
patients
the
first
suggests
that
all
doctors
are
women
the
second
that
they
are
all
men
clearly
neither
need
be
true
t
raditional
prescriptive
grammars
have
required
that
the
pronoun
after
quantifiers
such
as
every
and
some
be
masculine—and
in
general
that
the
generic
pronoun
be
the
masculine
one
many
people
find
this
norm
to
be
objectionable
and
would
like
to
find
expressions
that
would
not
give
any
indication
of
the
referent’s
sex
for
use
in
situations
where
sex
is
irrelevant
many
writers
now
use
forms
of
they
when
a
generic
pronoun
is
required

indefinite

constitute

they

little
if

they
are
a

class

for
this
reason

have
a

of

acting

wh-words
such
as
who
and
what
occur
in
a
wide
range
of
construc
tions
in
traditional
grammars
they
are
called
interrogative
or
relative
pronouns
these
forms
are
usually
distinguished
by
the
constructions
in
delahunty
and
garvey
which
they
function
but
there
is
little
formal
reason
to
separate
them
we
thus
list
them
as
a
single
group
in
table
we
will
briefly
explain
their
range
of
functions
here
and
go
into
more
detail
in
other
chapters
some
of
the
words
in
table
are
traditionally
called
pronouns
because
of
our
emphasis
on
form
we
will
not
use
this
label
some
of
the
members
of
the
group
function
as
pronouns
in
certain
constructions
but
not
in
others
to
call
them
pronouns
on
this
limited
basis

the
label
wh-word
is
a
mnemonic
that
clearly
applies
to
all
members
of
the
class
except
how
nevertheless
this
form
deserves
inclusion
on
the
basis
of
its
grammatical
behavior
wh-pronouns
perform
three
distinct
functions
a
introducing
information
questions
b
introducing
relative
clauses
c
introducing
noun
clauses
we
will
illustrate
these
functions
with
who
which
and
where
we
will
also
indicate
cases
in
which
these
words
can
occur
as
headwords
and
as
modifiers
an
information
question
requests
that
the
hearer
respond
with
some
in
formation
beyond
a
mere
yes
or
no
these
questions
appear
with
all
wh
words
except
whether
it
is
in
this
role
that
wh-words
are
traditionally
called
interrogative
pronouns
a

for
each
of
the
wh-words
in
table
except
whether
create
three
wh-questions
the
minor
parts
of

wh-words
also
introduce
relative
clauses
in
square
brackets
in
these
clauses
modify
nouns
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
we
will
see
how
they
follow
a
head
noun
as
part
of
a
noun
phrase
most
wh-words
can
introduce
relatives
a

for
each
of
the
wh-words
in
table
except
what
and
whether

ate

sentences
with
relative
clauses
create
a
sentence
with
a
relative
clause
beginning
with
what
have
you
ever
come
across
such
a
relative
clause
before
how
would
you
change
it
to
make
it
acceptable
in
formal
english
finally
wh-words
serve
to
introduce
noun
clauses
in
square
brackets
in
which
are
entire
clauses
that
function
as
if
they
were
noun
phrases
for
this
reason
the
entire
clause
can
often
be
replaced
by
a
simpler
noun
phrase
or
by
a
pronoun

grammatical
function(s
does

articles
articles
are
the
last
minor
class
associated
with
nouns
they
always
function
as
modifiers
of
the
head
noun
in
a
noun
phrase
and
traditionally
are
assumed
to
contain
only
two
words
the
indefinite
article
a(n
and
the
definite
article
the
a
a
visitor
b
the
united
nations
the
indefinite
article
has
two
written
forms
a
before
a
spoken
consonant
and
an
before
a
spoken
vowel
the
corresponding
spoken
forms
are
ey

and
n
at
least
when
spoken
in
isolation
the
definite
article
may
be
pronounced

before
a
spoken
consonant
and
i
before
a
spoken
vowel
though
there
is
no
indication
of
this
in
the
standard
spelling
a
may
occur
only
with
a
singular
noun
whereas
the
may
occur
with
a
singular
or
a
plural
one
generally
a(n
and
the
are
the
only
articles
recognized
for
english
how
ever
some
linguists
would
claim
that
there
is
a
plural
of
a
namely
some
pronounced
with
a
very
reduced
vowel
you
have
a
visitor
vs
you
have
some
visitors
and
a
case
can
be
made
for
a
zero
article
the
visitors
must
sign
in
vs
visitors
must
sign
in
and
a/the
moose
blocked
the
path
vs
moose
is
good
to
eat
while
the
two
traditional
articles
are
easily
recognized
their
meaning
is
quite
complex
they
are
part
of
a
system
of
devices
that
enable
com
municators
to
introduce
people
and
things
into
a
discourse
and
then
keep
track
of
them
as
the
discourse
continues
other
devices
in
this
system
are
pronouns
and
demonstratives
and
the
distinction
between
common
and
proper
nouns
somewhat
simplistically
the
system
works
as
follows
indefinite
articles
signal
the
entry
of
a
new
entity
into
the
discourse
e.g
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
big
bad
wolf
once
an
entity
has
been
introduced
it
can
be
referred
to
by
an
appropriate
personal
pronoun
e.g
he
lived
all
alone
or
it
can
be
assigned
a
proper
name
e.g
he
was
called
edgar
which
can
the
minor
parts
of
speechthen
be
used
to
refer
to
it
e.g
one
day
edgar
was
out
looking
for
his
next
meal
later
references
may
be
marked
by
a
definite
article
e.g
when
the
wolf
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
spotted
some
children
when
we
want
to
distinguish
one
entity
from
another
of
the
same
kind
we
can
use
the
demonstratives
e.g
edgar
said
to
himself
this
child
looks
far
tastier
than
that
one
using
the
plural
forms
of
the
demonstratives
we
can
of
course
distinguish
multiple
entities
e.g
but
those
children
look
tastiest
of
all
the
definite
article
the
demonstratives
the
personal
pronouns
and
proper
nouns
all
signal
definiteness
one
major
purpose
of
marking
a
noun
phrase
as
definite
is
to
indicate
the
speaker’s/writer’s
assumption
that
the
intended
hearer/reader
can
readily
identify
what
it
refers
to
the
general
pattern
is
that
we
provide
our
audiences
with
only
as
much
information
as
we
think
they
will
need
to
identify
what
an
np
refers
to
we
thereby
minimize
repetition
and
the
amount
of
effort
we
must
expend
in
producing
our
utterances
and
the
amount
of
effort
we
require
the
audience
to
expend
in
interpreting
them
and
we
can
rank
the
definite
expressions
according
to
the
amount
of
information
they
provide
nps
with
demonstratives
pro
vide
more
information
than
nps
with
definite
articles
which
provide
more
information
than
proper
names
which
provide
more
information
than
pro
nouns
another
reason
for
making
a
noun
phrase
definite
is
to
indicate
that
all
the
entities
relevant
in
a
situation
are
being
referred
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
there
are
books
strewn
on
a
desk
if
we
say
the
books
should
be
put
back
on
the
shelves
we
will
be
understood
to
mean
all
the
books
not
just
some
of
them
if
we
want
just
some
of
the
books
reshelved
then
we
have
to
find
a
characteristic
common
to
the
ones
we
want
reshelved
and
mention
that
in
our
sentence
e.g
the
linguistics
books
should
be
reshelved
in
this
case
we
will
be
understood
to
mean
all
the
linguistics
books
the
indefinite
article
a(n
indicates
that
the
speaker/writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
can
not
readily
identify
the
referent
of
the
np
contrast
a
and
b
a
i
saw
the
wolf
speaker
presents
information
as
readily
accessible
to
the
hearer
e.g
speaker
and
hearer
have
already
identified
a
wolf
and
are
now
referring
to
it
again
b
i
saw
a
wolf
speaker
presents
information
as
not
readily
acces
sible
to
the
hearer
e.g
speaker
is
introducing
reference
to
a
wolf
into
the
conversation
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
indefinite
article
is
normally
used
to
introduce
a
delahunty
and
garvey
new
entity
or
topic
into
a
discourse
another
important
meaning
associated
with
the
indefinite
article
is
cat
egorization
or
classification
an
indefinite
np
denotes
a
member
of
the
cat
egory
named
by
the
head
noun
of
the
np
dictionary
definitions
make
use
of
such
categorization
for
example

slate
plumage

check
several
other
dictionary
entries
to
see
if
they
also
use
the
indefinite
article
in
this
way
whether
a
noun
is
count

non-count

which
articles
may
modify

nps
may

a
class
of
entities
or
to
the
entire
class
for
example
the

be
interpreted
as
referring
to
a
single
specific
pig
or
to
the
entire
pig
species
when
we
refer
to
an
entire
class
we
are
said
to
be
making
generic

we
refer
to
one
or
more
specific

exercise
here
are
some
rules
that
are
typically
given
for
when
to
use
the
defi

article
for
each
rule
create
three
short
examples
to
illustrate
it
a
use
the
to
mark
a
noun
phrase
whose
referent
is
identifiable
in
the
situational
context
e.g
where’s
the
dean’s
office
b
use
the
to
mark
a
noun
phrase
whose
referent
has
already
been
introduced
e.g
a
rabbi
and
a
priest
went
into
a
bar
the
rabbi
said
to
the
priest
c
use
the
to
mark
a
noun
phrase
whose
referent
is
unique
e.g
the
earth
the
tallest
mountain
the
fifth
man
d
use
the
with
adjectives
and
nouns
that
name
groups
of
people
especially
when
we
are
referring
to
the
entire
group
e.g
the
the
minor
parts
of

the
russians
e
use
the
with
some
geographical
proper
nouns
e.g
the
pacific
the
philippines
but
cf
spain
not
the
spain
f
use
the
in
certain
date
formats
e.g
the
th
of

for
each
of
the
following
categories
of
words
determine
whether
they
do

typically
occur
with

e.g
albert
f
titles
and
names
together
e.g
president
kennedy
here
are
some
rules
that
are
typically
given
for
when
to
use
an
indefinite
article
remember
to
use
a
as
the
singular
indefinite
and
either
some
or
no
article
at
all
for
the
plural
e.g
a
book
some
books
books
for
each
rule
create
a
short
example
to
illustrate
it
a
use
an
indefinite
article
for
the
first
mention
of
an
entity
or
enti
ties
in
a
discourse
e.g
for
a
soccer
fan
few
things
are

cup
the
surgeon
introduced
some
radioactive
dye
into
the
patient’s
arteries
brain
injuries
are
frequent
in
combat
nb
no
article
modifies
brain
injuries
b
use
an
indefinite
article
or
no
article
to
classify/categorize
e.g
she
is
a
doctor
they
are
doctors
c
use
an
indefinite
article
or
no
article
with
certain
numbers
e.g
a
hundred
thousands

the

good
opinion
of
their
surrounding
acquaintances
the
late
owner
of
this
estate
was
a
single
man
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
and
who
for
many
years
of
his
life
had
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
but
her
death
which
happened
ten
years
before
his
own
produced
a
great
alteration
in
his
home
for
to
supply
her
loss
he
invited
and
received
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
mr
henry
dashwood
the
legal
inheritor
of
the
norland
estate
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intended
to
bequeath
it
in
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
neice
and
their
children
the
old
gentleman’s
days
were
comfortably
spent
his
the
minor

to
them
all
increased
the
constant
attention
of
mr
and
mrs
henry
dashwood
to
his
wishes
which
proceeded
not
merely
from
interest
but
from
goodness
of
heart
gave
him
every
degree
of
solid
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
children
added
a
relish
to
his
existence
by
a
former
marriage
mr
henry
dashwood
had
one
son
by
his
present
lady
three
daughters
the
son
a
steady
respectable
young
man
was
amply
provided
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
which
had
been
large
and
half
of
which
devolved
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
by
his
own
marriage
likewise
which
happened
soon
afterwards
he
added
to
his
wealth
to
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
norland
estate
was
not
so
really
important
as
to
his

small
auxiliary
verbs
in
this
section
we
discuss
auxiliary
verbs
which
we
mentioned
in
passing
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
auxiliary
verbs
always
occur
with
a
main
verb
though
the
main
verb
may
be
understood
that
is
omitted
and
implied
e.g
did
john
leave
he
did
leave
there
are
only
a
few
aux
iliaries
in
the
language
but
each
plays
several
important
grammatical
and
semantic
roles
the
english
auxiliaries
are
be
have
and
the
modal
verbs
can
could
may
might
shall
should
will
would
must
and
do
which
has
no
meaning
but
patterns
grammatically
like
a
modal
be
is
used
with
a
verb
in
its
ving
form
to
indicate
the
progressive
aspect
e.g
the
students
are
working
on
their
term
papers
be
is
also
used
with
a
past
participle
verb
form
ven
to
create
the
passive
voice
e.g
this
book
was
written
by
two
loony
linguists
have
is
used
with
a
ven
form
to
create
the
perfect
aspect
e.g
the
semester
has
come
to
an
end
do
and
the
modals
are
followed
by
a
verb
in
its
uninflected
form
the
form
used
to
cite
it
in
a
dictionary
e.g
we
shall
overcome
we
discuss
the
progressive
and
perfect
aspects
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
auxiliary
verbs
are
optional
elements
in
a
clause
but
up
to
four
may
oc
cur
together
regardless
of
how
many
occur
they
always
follow
this
order
modal
have
progressive
be
and
passive
be
as
you
can
demonstrate
for
your
self
by
rearranging
them
in
she
may
have
been
being
spied
on
by
homeland
security
agents
you
should
find
that
all
other
orders
are
ungrammatical
the
first
auxiliary
in
a
sentence
is
extremely
important
first
it
is
the
one
delahunty
and
garvey
that
is
marked
for
tense
if
the
clause
is
finite
in
she
should
have
been
work
ing
on
her
term
paper
should
is
the
first
auxiliary
and
its
d
indicates
that
it
is
in
the
past
tense
you
can
convince
yourself
of
the
accuracy
of
this
rule
by
removing
the
past
tense
marker
from
should
and
placing
it
on
any
of
the
other
auxiliaries
and
main
verb
e.g
she
shall
had
been
working
on
her
term
paper
you
should
find
that
all
other
orders
are
ungrammatical
we
discuss
tense
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
second
in
interrogative
clauses
it
is
always
the
first
auxiliary
that
is
moved
to
the
left
of
the
subject
if
we
turn
she
could
have
been
seriously
in
jured
into
a
question
it
is
the
could
as
the
first
auxiliary
that
moves
could
she
have
been
seriously
injured
again
you
can
test
the
accuracy
of
our
rule
by
moving
other
auxiliaries
to
the
left
of
the
subject
e.g
have
she
could
been
seriously
injured
third
in
negated
sentences
the
negative
particle
not
is
typically
placed
after
the
first
auxiliary
e.g
he
has
not
been
studying
very
hard
lately
t
ry
placing
it
elsewhere
in
the
sequence
to
see
what
happens
modal
verbs
if
a
modal
verb
occurs
in
a
clause
it
will
as
we
noted
be
the
first
of
any
auxiliaries
that
clause
contains
besides
occupying
the
same
sentential
posi
tion
modals
express
related
concepts
these
concepts
include
notions
such
as
a
necessity
either
logical
or
social
obligation
you
must
read
the
book
b
possibility
logical
or
social
permission
he
may
leave
the
room
c
ability
he
can
do
long
division
in
his
head
or
d
intention
either
definite
or
condi
tional
i
will/would/shall/should
write
another
pages
today
what
these
modal
concepts
all
have
in
common
is
that
they
indicate
the
basis
for
the
speaker’s
judgment
or
belief
about
the
truth
of
the
sentence
we
can
view
the
d/t
at
the
end
of
the
second
member
of
each
pair
of
modals
as
a
variant
of
the
past
tense
inflection
ed
this
allows
us
to
regard
each
pair
excluding
must
as
comprising
a
present
and
a
past
tense
form
to
see
why
this
is
so
consider
the
phenomenon
called
backshifting
backshifting
involves
the
change
from
present
tense
to
past
tense
forms
when
direct
speech
e.g
john
is
flying
to
toronto
tomorrow
is
converted
into
indirect
speech
when
the
verb
of
the
main
clause
is
in
the
past
tense
john
said
that
he
was
flying
to
toronto
tomorrow
sentences
involving
modals
require
a
shift
from
the
basic
form
to
the
past
tense
d/t
form
john
will
fly
out
tomorrow
becomes
john
said
that
he
would
fly

the
indirect

construction
e.g

sometimes
associated
with
paraphrases

he

he

this

looked
up
let’s
consider
the
complexities
of
the
word
down
using
the
following
sentences
as
our
data
a
i
cut
down
the
tree
b
i
fell
down
the
hill
c
i
cut
the
tree
down
d
i
fell

g
i

h
i
fell
it
down
i
i

down

j
i

down
it
sentences
a
b
appear
to
be
parallel
because
in
both
down
appears
before
the
nps
the
tree
and
the
hill
however
this
parallelism
is
broken
in
c
d
in
c
down
is
grammatical
after
the
np
but
in
d
it
is
not
this
difference
in
behavior
suggests
that
down
may
represent
two
different
parts
of
speech
in
these
sentences
semantically
we
sense
an
idiomatic
unity
in
cut
down
that
we
do
not
sense
in
fell
down
in
fact
cut
down
could
be
replaced
by
one
word
toppled
or
felled
on
formal
and
semantic
grounds
then
down
seems
to
rep
resent
different
parts
of
speech
in
a
and
b
the
fact
that
down
the
hill
seems
to
have
moved
as
a
single
unit
in
f
suggests
that
in
that
and
related
sentences
down
is
a
preposition
heading
a
prepositional
phrase
for
down
in
a
we
have
no
ready-made
traditional
label
in
such
sentences
we
will
call
it
a
particle
using
a
term
coined
recently
by
linguists
and
verb
particle
combinations
like
cut
down
look
up
we
will
call
phrasal
verbs
next
consider
the
word
down
in
the
sentences
below
a
i
fell
down
the
hill
b
i
fell
down
assuming
that
down
is
a
true
preposition
in
a
we
note
in
b
that
the
minor
parts
of
speechdown
is
not
followed
by
a
noun
phrase
nor
has
it
been
stranded
since
no
noun
phrase
that
could
be
construed
as
its
object
occurs
elsewhere
in
the
sentence
moreover
we
do
not
infer
from
b
that
i
fell
down
some
in
clined
place—any
more
than
we
understand
that
some
object
did
or
did
not
cause
me
to
fall
since
we
cannot
apply
any
test
of
moveability
to
the
right
that
helped
us
to
identify
particles
we
have
no
justification
for
calling
down
in
b
a
particle
must
we
then
invent
a
new
part
of
speech
the
answer
is
yes—unless
we
can
fit
the
word
into
some
other
existing
part
of
speech
can
you
think
of
a
candidate
for
the
word
down
consider
sentences
a
d
a
harriet
visited
often
b
often
harriet
visited
c
i
fell
down
d
down
i
fell
these
sentences
provide
evidence
that
down
in
b/28c
may
be
an
adverb
since
it
fits
criteria
for
adverbs
namely
that
of
relative
moveability
that
it
modifies
a
verb
and
that
it
represents
direction
in
practice
we
would
like
to
have
more
support
for
our
analysis
than
this
but
sometimes
we
do
not
have
that
luxury
we
should
note
however
the
semantic
motivation
for
the
tendency
of
prepositions
to
blend
with
adverbs
if
you
turn
back
to
our
discussion
of
adverbs
you
will
notice
that
the
meanings
expressed
by
adverbs
e.g
time
place
and
manner
partially
coincide
with
those
of
prepositions
this
tendency
for
parts
of
speech
to
overlap
in
meaning
is
just
one
more
reason
to
prefer
an
analysis
that
separates
them
on
the
basis
of
form
intensifiers
our
earlier
discussion
of
adjectives
and
adverbs
made
reference
to
a
class
of
words
specifically
associated
with
them
this
class
includes
words
like
more
most
very
quite
rather
somewhat
and
a
few
others
t
raditional
grammars
often
call
such
words
degree
adverbs
as
if
they
were
ordinary
ad
verbs—like
extremely
and
thoroughly
that
happen
to
indicate
the
extent
to
which
the
meaning
of
the
adjective
or
adverb
holds
if
you
consider
the
criteria
for
adverbs
that
we
suggested
earlier
you
will
quickly
realize
that
the
words
we
have
listed
as
intensifiers—even
though
they
do
indicate
degree—do
not
share
the
formal
or
functional
characteristics
of
adverbs
for
instance
intensifiers
do
not
have
the
moveability
of
true
adverbs
nor
can
they
occur
in
the
comparative
or
superlative
constructions
nor
can

we
will
thus
refer
to

as

word

the
major

of
these

to

two

when

as
in
lou
admitted
his
mistake
but
bud
didn’t
in
such
examples
however
the
difference
in
conjuncts
is
illusory
for
the
second
conjunct
can
be
reconstructed
as
a
structure
formally
comparable
to
the
first
as
the
paraphrase
indicates
lou
admitted
his
mistake
but
bud
did
not
admit
his
mistake
the
literal
meaning
of
and
is
equivalent
to
mathematical
or
logical
so
jack
and
jill
means
jack
jill
so
if
jack
and
jill
went
up
the
hill
is
true
then
jack
went
up
the
hill
is
true
and
jill
went
up
the
hill
is
true
however
in
certain
contexts
and
communicates
more
than
just
for
example
we
would
normally
interpret
jack
fell
down
and
broke
his
crown
to
mean
jack
fell
down
and
then
because
he
fell
down
he
broke
his
crown
so
amongst
other
meanings
and
can
communicate
the
order
in
which
events
took
place
and
that
an
earlier
event
caused
a
later
one
the
literal
meaning
but
is
pretty
much
equivalent
to
that
of
and
namely
that
both
conjuncts
are
true
however
but
adds
the
complica
tion
that
an
expectation
set
up
by
the
first
conjunct
is
to
be
rejected
for
example
if
you
go
to
the
dean’s
office
and
ask
her
assistant
whether
she
is
in
you
might
get
the
response
she’s
in
but
you
can’t
see
her
now
in
this
case
she’s
in
is
true
and
you
can’t
see
her
now
is
true
but
acknowledges
that
if
she’s
in
is
true
then
you
might
reasonably
expect
that
you
would
be
able
to
see
her
however
it
rejects
this
expectation
like
and
or
can
conjoin
an
indefinite
number
of
expressions
generally
when
or
conjoins
expressions
it
indicates
that
only
one
of
the
expressions
is
true
for
example
if
i
say
george
dick
or
albert
should
go
to
jail
then
i
am
saying
that
only
one
of
the
three
should
go
to
jail
however
i
can
override
this
exclusivity
by
adding
something
like
or
all
three
the
minor
parts
of
speechsubordinating
conjunctions
subordinating
conjunctions
as
the
name
suggests
differ
from
coordina
tors
by
connecting
structures
of
unequal
grammatical
status
in
subordina
tion
one
of
the
structures
is
grammatically
superior
or
dominant
and
the
other
is
grammatically
inferior
or
subordinate
the
subordinate
structure
is
a
sub-part
of
the
larger
dominant
structure
as
you’d
expect
the
subor
dinate
structure
is
the
one
introduced
by
the
subordinating
conjunction
a
second
difference
between
coordinating
and
subordinating
conjunc
tions
is
that
the
latter
have
a
restricted
range
they
can
connect
clauses
only
thus
a
structure
introduced
by
a
subordinating
conjunction
will
be
a
sub
ordinate
clause
it
is
of
course
possible
for
one
clause
to
be
subordinate
bolded
to
a
clause
that
is
itself
subordinate
underlined
for
example
the
tv
news
reported
that
the
nominee
claimed
that
he
was
not
a
crook
we
will
investigate
subordinate
clauses
more
fully
in
our
chapter
on
multi
clause
sentences
for
the
moment
we
will
simply
mention
three
important
types
of
subordinate
clause
and
identify
the
conjunctions
that
may
introduce
them
the
subordinating
conjunctions
are
classified
according
to
the
type
of
clause
they
introduce
the
three
types
of
subordinate
clauses
are
adverbial
nominal
and
relative
subordinating
adverbial
conjunctions
adverbial
clauses
like
adverbs
function
as
modifiers
of
verbs
or
sentences
they
are
introduced
by
a
group
of
words
that
we
will
call
subordinating
adverbial
conjunctions

delahunty
and

table
groups
sacs
semantically
in
a
way
that
makes
clear
their
over
lap
with
adverbs
as
we
have
just
seen
prepositions
also
overlap
with
ad
verbs
so
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
prepositions
have
affinities
with
sacs
these
affinities
are
more
than
semantic
several
items
of
table
also
appear
on
the
lists
of
prepositions
table
and
because
of
this
overlap
students
may
experience
difficulties
in
telling
a
preposition
from
a
sac
and
a
prepositional
phrase
from
an
adverbial
clause
a
simple
way
to
keep
the
two
clear
is
to
remember
that
a
preposition
only
occurs
in
construction
with
a
following
noun
phrase
and
a
sac
is
followed
by
a
clause
let’s
con
sider
an
example
a
i
left
after
the
party
b
i
left
after
the
party
ended
in
a
after
is
followed
only
by
a
noun
phrase
the
party
and
so
must
be
a
preposition
in
b
after
is
followed
by
both
a
noun
phrase
the
party
and
a
verb
phrase
ended
that
together
constitute
a
clause
thus
after
is
a
sac
in
b
we
can
confirm
our
formal
analysis
further
by
moving
the
group
of
words
after
the
party
a
after
the
party
i
left
b
after
the
party
i
left
ended
since
phrases
often
move
as
a
unit
the
prepositional
phrase
in
a
can
be
relocated
at
the
front
of
the
sentence
as
it
has
been
in
a
but
in
b
after
the
party
cannot
be
moved
as
the
ungrammaticality
of
b
shows
thus
it
must
not
be
a
complete
expression
in
fact
the
structure
governed
by
after
in
b
is
the
clause
the
party
ended
as
shows
after
the
party
ended
i
left
clauses
like
after
the
party
ended
are
adverbial
because
they
function
much
as
adverbs
do
they
have
meanings
similar
to
those
of
adverbs
and
they
are
relatively
moveable
exercise
create
at
least
one
sentence
containing
an
adverbial
clause
for
each
of
the
semantic
categories
represented
in
table

minor
parts
of
speechnominal
conjunctions
nominal
clauses
function
just
like
noun
phrases
typically
function—i.e
as
subjects
objects
and
complements
when
they
do

are
introduced

a
set
of
subordinating

of

some
complexities
of
subordinating
conjunctions
subordinating
conjunctions
have
several
properties
that
make
them
more
complicated
than
this
basic
presentation
suggests
one
that
deserves
men
tion
is
the
tendency
of
subordinating
conjunctions
to
be
omitted
from
sen
tences
in
which
their
presence
is
easily
inferred
examples

nominal
that
c
the
reason
she

wasn’t

relative
why
or
that
a
note
on
that
grammatically
that
is
particularly
interesting
largely
because
it
belongs
to
at
least
four
different
parts
of
speech
first
it
can
be
a
demonstrative
pro
noun
that
functions
either
as
a
modifier
e.g
that
answer
is
correct
or
as
the
head
of
a
noun
phrase
e.g
that
is
correct
second
it
can
introduce
a
relative
clause
e.g
the
answer
that
she
gave
was
correct
third
that
can
act
as
a
noun
clause
connector
e.g
i
said
that
the
answer
was
correct
fourth
it
can
appear
as
part
of
a
subordinating
adverbial
conjunction
indicating
either
result
or
purpose
e.g
the
answer
was
so
persuasive
that
it
astounded
us
all
the
answer
was
phrased
so
that
it
would
confuse
everyone
so
how
can
you
determine
which
class
that
belongs
to
in
a
particular
sentence
one
useful
test
is
that
of
substitution
if
you
can
substitute
it
for
that
you
have
a
headword
demonstrative
if
you
can
substitute
the
you
have
a
modifying
demonstrative
if
you
can
substitute
who
or
which
for
that
it
introduces
a
relative
clause
if
you
cannot
make
any
of
these
replacements
you
have
either
a
noun
clause
connector
or
a
sac
distinguishing
the
sac
is
very
simple
since
it
occurs
normally
with
the
word
so
either
next
to
it
or
nearby
other
minor
parts
of
speech
while
our
catalogue
of
parts
of
speech
includes
nearly
all
the
words
of
eng
lish
we
should
ask
whether
other
categories
might
be
identified
there
is
no
reason
in
principle
to
believe
that
we
have
discovered
all
the
parts
of
speech
any
more
than
to
believe
that
we
have
discovered
all
the
inhabitable
planets
in
our
galaxy
certainly
we
would
expect
to
find
other
parts
of
speech
if
we
dealt
with
languages
other
than
english
japanese
for
instance
has
words
similar
to
the
minor
parts
of
speechour
prepositions
except
that
they
follow
rather
than
precede
their
associated
noun
phrases
thus
english
of
a
book
would
be
rendered
in
japanese
as
hon
ni
literally
book
of
because
they
follow
their
nouns
these
japanese
words
are
often
called
postpositions
those
familiar
with
traditional
grammar
will
also
recall
one
part
of
speech
that
we
have
not
mentioned
the
interjection
this
class
includes
words
such
as
shucks
darn
gee
wow
and
a
host
of
saltier
expressions
usu
ally
a
grammar
will
list
the
tamer
interjections
and
let
the
matter
drop
interjections
have
some
interesting
properties
first
they
are
not
gram
matically
connected
to
other
parts
of
the
sentences
in
which
they
occur
and
consequently
are
typically
separated
from
the
remainder
of
their
sentence
by
commas
they
typically
indicate
the
speaker’s
attitude
or
feelings
about
what
he
is
expressing
e.g
well
our
budget
deficit
is
not
as
large
as
that
of
the
axis
of
evil
individual
expressions
also
have
certain
unusual
properties
darn
for
example
enters
into
a
variety
of
constructions
a
darn
it
b
that
darn
cat
c
i
don’t
give
a
darn
in
a
darn
seems
to
act
like
a
verb
expressing
a
wish
for
damnation
darn
of
course
is
a
euphemism
for
damn
though
its
literal
meaning
is
rarely
intended
since
even
atheists
can
use
it
in
b
darn
seems
to
mod
ify
cat
though
it
is
not
an
adjective
by
formal
criteria
that
darner
cat
that
darnest
cat
that
very
darn
cat
though
we
can
say
the
darndest
thing
hap
pened
c
suggests
that
darn
could
be
a
noun
though
we
don’t
seem
to
be
able
to
give
more
than
one
darn
at
a
time
i
don’t
give
two
darns
aside
from
interjections
we
have
already
seen
one
important
way
in
which
new
parts
of
speech
may
emerge
they
may
be
distinguished
from
other
classes
of
which
they
were
thought
to
be
normal
members
for
in
stance
we
separated
intensifiers
from
the
category
of
adverbs
and
particles
from
prepositions
in
distinguishing
a
group
of
words
as
a
separate
part
of
speech
linguists
attempt
to
direct
our
attention
to
a
set
of
formal
func
tional
or
semantic
similarities
and
differences
as
a
result
some
catego
ries
will
be
particular
to
a
specific
book
rather
than
to
english
grammar
in
general
the
practice
of
reclassifying
words
is
in
fact
relatively
common
especially
as
we
discover
more
about
language
studying
parts
of
speech
mirrors
the
study
of
ecological
characteristics
of
plants
and
animals
in
na
ture
so
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
as
we
learn
more
about
a
particular
delahunty
and
garvey
species
we
discover
unexpected
similarities
between
it
and
other
apparently
unrelated
species
thus
if
prepositions
and
adverbs
are
not
as
distinct
as
we
once
thought
our
discovery
of
this
fact
derives
from
our
closer
observation
of
their
verbal
ecology
references
and
resources

introduction
in
this
chapter
we
discuss
word
meaning
while
it’s
uncontroversial
that
words
mean
it
is
far
from
clear
how
they
mean
or
indeed
what
meaning
is
because
dictionaries
are
so
familiar
we
begin
our
discussion
from
the
point
of
view
of
dictionary
entries
which
are
designed
primarily
to
describe
the
meanings
of
words
though
they
do
much
else
besides
we
discuss
two
ap
proaches
to
modeling
word
meaning
and
then
move
to
a
discussion
of
the
meanings
of
words
as
they
might
be
stored
in
human
minds
and
of
the
ways
in
which
book
and
mental
dictionaries
are
alike
and
different
we
would
be
surprised
if
anyone
reading
this
book
had
never
consulted
a
dictionary
however
our
experience
over
several
decades
of
teaching
about
language
is
that
very
few
people
read
the
introductions
front
matter
of
dic
tionaries
they
may
have
had
for
many
years
indeed
our
experience
strongly
suggests
that
most
people
believe
in
the
myth
of
the
dictionary
a
unique
authoritative
and
accurate
source
of
information
on
words
their
spellings
meanings
and
histories
of
which
actual
dictionaries
are
merely
longer
or
shorter
versions
everyone
especially
teachers
should
be
aware
that
dictionaries
are
not
all
cut
from
the
same
cloth
rather
they
differ
in
substantial
ways
which
their
users
ignore
at
the
cost
of
misinterpreting
what
they
read
the
goals
of
the
exercise
just
below
are
to
raise
your
awareness
of
the
differences
among
dictionaries
to
show
you
that
it
is
essential
to
adopt
as
critical
a
stance
toward
dictionaries
as
you
would
toward
any
other
commercial
product
and
to
encourage
you
to
examine
dictionaries
carefully
as
you
buy
them
for
yourselves
have
them
bought
for
your
schools
or
recommend
them
to
your
students
more
generally
teachers
and
students
should
have
some
appreciation
of
the
complexity
of
issues
regarding
linguistic
meaning
a
topic
that
has
chal
lenged
western
thinking
for
over
two
and
a
half
millennia
we
have
included
several
items
in
our
references
and
resources
to
this
chapter
that
we
hope
will
help
develop
that
appreciation
the
chapter
will
give
you
a
basic
vocab
ulary
for
use
in
conceptualizing
and
discussing
meaning
as
well
as
concepts
delahunty
and
garvey
to
augment
our
discussion
of
morphology
and
parts
of
speech
dictionary
entries
dictionaries
are
probably
the
sources
of
information
on
words
you
are
most
familiar
with
so
we
begin
our
discussion
of
words
by
exploring
the
information
dictionaries
provide
and
the
ways
in
which
they
present
it
exercise
just
to
see
how
much
you
may
have
been
taking
for
granted
and
how
much
of
that
was
right
and
how
much
was
mistaken
write
a
page
critical
review
comparing/contrasting
two
reasonably
substantial
dictionaries
i.e
compact
collegiate
or
larger
pocket
dictionaries
are
too
small
suitable
for
your
purposes
e.g
for
your
own
personal
or
professional
uses
or
to
recommend
to
the
kinds
of
students
you
may
teach
we
think
you
will
learn
a
lot
about
dictionaries
by
comparing
contrasting
a
learner’s
dictionary
with
one
for
native
english
speak
ers
make
sure
to
give
their
full
names
editions
publishers
dates
of
publication
and
sizes
indicate
the
size
of
the
dictionaries
by
number
of
pages
or
entries
your
instructor
should
approve
your
choice
of
dic
tionaries
before
you
begin
as
this
is
to
be
a
critical
review
you
should
clearly
articulate
for
yourself
and
your
readers
the
criteria
you
use
to
evaluate
the
dictionaries
compare
contrast
their
front
matters
i.e
everything
from
the
front
cover
to
the
beginning
of
the
alphabetical
listing
of
words
and
their
back
matters
i.e
everything
from
the
end
of
the
alphabetical
listings
to
the
inside
back
cover
pay
particular
attention
to
a

the

this
kind
of
system
works
if

as
the
lexicographers
expect

if
you
don’t

how
that

or
if
you
pronounce
it
in
an
unusual

for

according

then
the

learners’
dictionaries
typically
use
ipa
symbols
to
indicate
pronuncia
tion
these
symbols
have
fixed
sound
values
independent
of
anyone’s
native
language
dialect
or
idiosyncrasies
so
they
avoid
some
of
the
problems
as

with

guides
however
if
like
most
american
students
you
don’t
know
the
sound
values
of
the
ipa
symbols
they
are
quite
unhelpful
it
is
important
to
understand
your
dic

way
of
indicating

and
perhaps
to
learn
a
relevant
set
of
the
ipa
symbols
delahunty
and
garvey
parts
of

it

it
also
marks

ahd
adds
the
adverb

forms
at

for

because
their

however
if
the
meanings
of
the
derived
words
are
not
readily
predictable
from
the
meaning
of
the

then

a
brief
sketch

in
this
case
modern
english
jealousy
is
descended
from

was
borrowed
from
the
old
french
word
gelos

in

came
from

a

that

issue
as
a

grammatical
one
misinforms
its

cide

that

grammatically
not

being
the
only
existing
one
of
its
type
according
to
this
grammatical
categorization
expressions
such
as
almost
unique
and
very
unique
should
be
ungrammatical
though
they
are
widely
used
by
native
english
speakers
including
highly
educated
ones
this
puts
the
grammatical
horse
before
the
usage
cart
languages
change
and
one
way
in
which
they
change
is
by
extending
the
range
of
ways
in
which
words
may
be
used
for
instance
by
broadening
the
scope
of
a
non

adjective
by
allowing
it
to
be

unique

only
a
non

treat
it

that
way

what

its
users
to
the
fact
that
under
some
circumstances
some
people
will
object
to

unique
what
it
actually
does
somewhat
contradictorily
is
add
more
generally
unusual

in
some
way
note
that

are

it

to

what
your

these
are
typically
given
in

though
there
are

and
many

include

the

dictionary
are
likely
to
be
very
similar
to
the

given
for

this
is
because
modern
english

are
representatives
of
a
lexi

tradition
that
is
many
centuries
old
it
is
also
because
crafting

within
the

imposed
by
that

is
constraining
and
difficult
and
because
lexicographers
look

see
how
their

we
will
look
at
some
of
the
devices
lexicogra

use
to
craft

below
if
every

were
associated
with
only
a

and
if

ferent

were
associated

then
the
lexicogra

task
would
be
considerably
simplified
although
dictionaries
might
be
rather
larger
than
they
are
now
however
as
our
examples
have
shown
and
as
a
quick
flick
through
a
dictionary
will
confirm
many
if
not
most
entry

are
associated
with
multiple

given
that
lexicographers
have
to
decide
on
the
best
strategy
to
represent
the

should
there

entry
with
lots
of
senses
or
should
there
be

tiple

lexicographers
have
developed

this
principle
is

now
look
at
how

are
expressed
if
the
dictionary
is
not
a
bilingual
one
then
the
definitions
are
expressed
in
the
same
language
as
the
headword
so
there
is
a
built-in
circularity
for
example
the
first

of

is
sodium
chloride
p
and
the

wnwd

the
words

in

you

english
learners’

attempt
to
deal
with
this
problem
by

a

words

provide
lists
of
synonyms
distinguished
by
com
ments
after
the
main
body
of
the
entry
after
the
synonyms
they
provide
lists
of
antonyms
antonyms
are
traditionally
defined
as
words
with
op
posite
meanings
such
as
up
and
down
good
and
bad
and
the
like
though
they
must
share
some
important
aspect
of
their
meanings
for
instance
large
and
small
share
the
notion
of
size
however
apple
and
eraser
are
not
antonyms
because
they
share
little
if
any
meaning
aside
from
physical
object
we
distinguish
several
types
of
antonym
cruse
complementary
antonyms
are
pairs
of
words
such
that
if
one
word
ap
plies
the
other
cannot
for
example
alive
and
dead
if
a
person
is
alive
he
or
she
cannot
be
dead
and
vice
versa
other
examples
are
hit-miss
pass-fail
open-closed
gradable
antonyms
denote
opposing
positions
on
some
scale
for
ex
ample
hot
and
cold
indicate
opposite
positions
on
a
temperature
scale
be
cause
scales
are
continuous
phenomena
we
can
indicate
varying
positions
on
them
by
modifying
the
words
e.g
hotter
hottest
awfully
hot
miserably
cold
the
values
between
and
beyond
the
antonyms
may
also
be
lexicalized
in
between
hot
and
cold
we
have
warm
tepid
cool
and
beyond
hot
and
cold
there
is
burning
scalding
and
freezing
among
others
other
gradable
pairs
include
tall-short
wide-narrow
big-small
strong-weak
heavy-light
high-low
you
probably
noticed
that
the
members
of
these
pairs
are
not
entirely
parallel
one
seems
to
be
more
basic
or
unmarked
than
the
other
we
use
the
basic
unmarked
form
to
ask
questions
when
we
have
no
specific
expectation
that
the
marked
form
describes
the
situation
i.e
when
the
question
is
not
loaded
toward
the
marked
form
for
example
ordinarily
if
we
want
to
know
how
strong
someone
is
we
simply
ask
how
strong
is
he
or
she
if
however
we
assume
that
this
person
is
weaker
than
some
norm
then
we
use
the
marked
member
of
the
word
pair
how
weak
is
he
or
she
the
marked
unmarked
distinction
is
important
in

literary
theories

you
probably
also
noticed

the
scales
we

a

very
likely
to
be
much
larger
than

non-gradable
antonyms
cannot
be
modified
often
because
they
denote
absolute
differences
e.g
metabolic
is
non-gradable
it
does
not
accept
the
comparative
or
the
superlative
or
modification
by
degree
adverb

most
metabolic
excessively

very
metabolic
other
non-gradables

words
that
represent
movement
in
opposite
di
rections
such
as
advance-retreat
go
away)-come
back
ascend-descend
rise
fall
go-return
fill-empty
open-close
conversive
antonyms
represent
the
same
situation
from
two
points
of
view
for
example
if
the
cat
is
higher
than
the
bird
then
the
bird
is
lower
than
the
cat
the
vertical
relationship
between
the
bird
and
the
cat
can
be
viewed
from
two
points
of
view
lower
than
and
higher
than
another
ex
ample
is
wife-husband
if
tarzan
is
jane’s
husband
then
jane
is
tarzan’s
wife
other
examples
include
buy-sell
give-receive
own-belong
to
above-below
while
synonyms
and
antonyms
are
words
at
the
same
semantic
level
word
meanings
may
also
be
hierarchically
related
to
each
other
for
ex

a

is
a
kind
of
duck
which
is
a
kind
of
bird
we

represent
this

duck
mallard
the
meaning
bird
is
included
in
the
meaning
duck
which
in
turn
is
included
in
the
meaning
mallard
or
from
the
bottom
up
the
meaning
mallard
includes
the
meaning
duck
which
includes
the
meaning
bird
this
relationship
is
called
hyponymy
the
lower
terms
are
the
hyponyms
of
the
higher
terms
which
are
the
superordinates
or
hypernyms
of
the
lower

similarly
the
meaning
of
rose
includes
the
meaning
of
flower
con

something
is
a
rose
then
it
must
also
be
a
flower
conversely
the

of
things
we
call
roses
is
included

restaurant
customer’s
order
to
refer
to
the
customer
is
a
very
productive
source
of
metonymy
for
instance
a
waiter
might
say
the
fishburger
wants
more
french
fries
to
identify
a
particular
customer
and
their
request
the
use
of
personal
names
to
refer
to

that
the

metonymy
is
occasionally

basis

permanent

look
up

in
a

etymological
information
such
as
ahd
metaphor
is
yet
another
relationship
among
words
it
is
based
on
per
ceived
similarities
between
entities
and
word
meanings
are
often
extended
to
denote
entities
similar
in
some
ways
to
the
ones
more
typically
denoted
by
the
word
many
metaphors
are
based
on
body
parts
for
example
ahd
p
includes
in
its
meanings
for
head
the
head
of
a
boil
the
head
of
a
tool
such
as
a
hammer
a
head
of
cabbage
the
head
of
a
group
the
head
of
a
phrase
and
lots
of
others
all
metaphorically
derived
from
the
central
meaning
of
head
namely
that
mass
of
bone
and
brain
that
sits
atop
your
neck
mouth
and
foot
also
have
multiple
metaphoric
meanings
which
your
dictionary
should
list
because
metaphorical
senses
are
extensions
of
the
basic
senses
of
words
they
develop
historically
later
than
them
some
extensions

be

for
instance
we
do
not
think
of
the
nose
of
a
river
or
a
bottle
but
there
may
be
some
general
principles
in
language
for
metaphorical
creation
for
instance
english
seems
to
have
a
principle
by
which
color
words
may
be
extended
to
psychological
states
e.g
blue
sad
red
with
anger
green
with
envy
yellow
cowardly
black
mood
see

exercise
compare
and
contrast
a
regular
dictionary
with
a
thesaurus
paying
particular
attention
to
the
ways
in
which
both
are
organized
and
the
ways
in
which
meanings
are
represented
what
purposes
do
you
think
each

designed
for
rhetoricians
literary
critics
and
others
interested
in
figures
of
speech

have
distinguished
many
types
and
subtypes
those
re
lated
to
metonymy
are
particularly
interesting
you
might
investigate

discuss
their
implications

thought-provoking

of

of

how
do
we
know
words
have
meaning
by
posing
this
question
we
do
not
intend
to
cast
doubt
on
the
proposition
that
words
have
meanings
rather
we
want
to
spell
out
some
good
reasons
to
believe
it
in
our
chapter
on
concepts
of
language
we
observed
that
our
linguistic
competence
allows
us
to
do
many
things
recall
that
competence
is
unconscious
linguistic
knowledge
which
includes
knowledge
of
the
meanings
of
words
examples
such
as
the
ones
below
tell
us
only
that
such
knowledge
must
exist
not
what
it
actually
is
our
competence
enables
us
to
distinguish
between
well
and
ill-formed
strings
of
words
and
to
detect
grammatical
struc
ture
crucially
for
our
current
discussion
it
enables
us
to
detect
meaning
relations
among
expressions
including
whether
an
expression
has
a
coher
ent
meaning
or
not
a
whether
expressions
paraphrase
each
other
that
is
whether
they
are
synonymous
b
whether
words
are
related
by
hyponymy
c
partonymy
d
antonymy
e
whether
a
word
fan
is
ambiguous
f
and
whether
a
word
is
used
metaphorically
g
as
well
as
all
the
other
meaning
relations
we
identified
above
these
abilities
are
strong
evidence
that
word
meanings
are
real
and
not
just
figments
of
linguists’
imaginations
a
colorless
green
ideas
sleep
furiously
b
groundhog—woodchuck
c
lizard—reptile
d
elbow—arm
e
big—small
above—below
open—closed
f
that
fan
is
very
annoying
g
i’ll
dig
with
it
sentence
g
is
from
seamus
heaney’s
poem
digging
in
the
minimal
context
given
in
g
it
would
probably
be
understood
as
a
spade
or
some
other
such
implement
and
dig
would
be
interpreted
as
turning
over
soil
in
a
garden
or
the
like
however
in
the
larger
context
of
the
entire
poem
it
re
fers
to
a
pen
in
the
poet’s
hand
and
dig
must
be
interpreted
metaphorically
consequently
the
sentence
is
ambiguous
between
a
literal
and
a
metaphori
cal
meaning
examples
such
as
those
in
could
easily
be
multiplied
but
these
few
should
make
clear
a
simple
idea
linguistic
competence
includes
an
unconscious
knowledge
of
the
literal
meanings
of
words
while
this
conclusion
might
seem
trivial
it
conceals
several
less-than-obvious
points
first
it
suggests
that
word
meaningspeakers
carry
around
in
their
minds
something
like
a
dictionary
of
their
language
however
there
is
good
evidence
that
speakers’
mental
dictionaries
are
quite
different
from
the
book
dictionaries
of
a
language
for
instance
no
book
dictionary
will
tell
you
that
the
words
idea
and
sleep
cannot
literally
be
combined
as
subject
and
predicate
linguists
often
use
the
terms
lexicon
or
mental
lexicon
to
refer
to
this
aspect
of
our
linguistic
competence
and
to
emphasize
its
difference
from
written
dictionaries
in
fact
the
nature
of
the
mental
lexicon
is
still
unclear
we
will
explore
some
of
its
characteristics
below
second
you
should
not
confuse
knowing
the
meaning
of
a
word
with
being
able
to
give
it
a
satisfactory
definition
definition-stating
is
a
learned
ability
and
is
only
marginally
necessary
in
most
communication
it
is
also
far
beyond
the
normal
capacities
of
people
the
eminent
lexicographer
sidney
landau
expresses
the
point
simply
by
general
definer
he
means
one
versed
in
common
rather
than
technical
vocabulary
it
is
difficult
to
find
highly
skilled
general
definers
such
people
are
about
as
rare
as
good
poets
there
are
probably
fewer
than
a
hundred
experi
enced
general
definers
in
the
whole
of
the
united
states

what

did
you

into
how
did
you
solve
them
third
whatever
the
nature
of
the
mental
lexicon
it
clearly
must
show
that
words
are
related
to
one
another
to
put
it
negatively
words
are
not
just
listed
in
our
competence
in
alphabetical
or
any
other
simple
order
rather
they
are
as
we
have
seen
interconnected
in
complex
ways
these
interconnec
tions
determine
which
words
can
and
cannot
occur
together
in
grammatical
constructions—e.g
as
in
a
interconnections
relate
families
of
words
re
lated
by
polysemy
synonymy
meronymy
antonymy
and
other
sense
relations
delahunty
and
garvey
some
models
and
explanations
of
word
meaning
since
published
dictionaries
do
not
offer
a
very
useful
model
of
our
lexical
competence
linguists
have
struggled
to
present
more
plausible
ones
besides
having
to
account
for
the
observations
noted
above
they
must
also
explain
the
fact
that
while
the
human
brain
is
finite
an
individual’s
vocabulary
may
be
very
large
estimates
for
an
educated
person’s
vocabulary
run
anywhere
from
to
words
the
largest
unabridged
dictionaries
of
english
con
tain
well
over
half
a
million
entries
clearly
however
no
two
individual
speak
ers
of
a
language
have
exactly
the
same
vocabulary
if
this
is
so
how
can
we
hope
to
describe
the
vastness
and
variability
of
lexical
competence
a
general
solution
is
to
describe
not
the
vocabulary
of
a
single
individual
or
the
entire
word-hoard
of
english
but
instead
to
envisage
the
general
properties
according
to
which
the
vocabulary
of
any
individual—or
of
any
language—can
be
con
structed
there
are
two
basic
models
of
lexical
structure
the
network
model
and
the
componential
model
the
network
model
the
network
model
n-model
posits
that
semantic
competence
is
to
be
ex
plained
on
the
assumption
that
words
have
certain
primitive
semantic
rela
tions
with
each
other
in
other
words
our
semantic
competence
does
not
consist
of
knowing
definitions
at
all
but
rather
of
knowing
how
words
relate
to
each
other
you
may
recall
from
your
literary
theory
classes
that
this
is
close
to
the
saussurean/structuralist
approach
the
primitive
relations
most
com
monly
explored

for
further
elaboration
see

the

characterizes
not
just
the
semantic
relations
among
separate
words
it
can
also
describe
the
relationships
between
the
senses
of
individual
words
for
instance
if
you
look
up
the

a

you
will
find

broken

the

is
based
on
the
premise
that
word
delahunty
and
garvey
meanings
are
complex
and
can
be
viewed
as
composed
of
basic
indivisible
units
of
meaning
these
units
are
usually
called
components
though
some
times
you
will
see
them
referred
to
as
features
or
sememes
components
are
often
regarded
as
pure
concepts
not
to
be
equated
with
the
words
of
any
language
which
is
why
they
are
typically
written
in
capital
letters
from
this
point
of
view
a
word
is
essentially
a
shorthand
way
of
grouping
a
set
of
concepts
under
a
single
label
some
of
the
concepts

some

the
components
listed
in
table
are
just
a
sample
of
those
that
have
been
proposed
but
they
are
adequate
to
illustrate
the
thrust
of
the
c
model
for
instance
in
this
model
the
word
alive
is
shorthand
for
the
component
animate
dead
is
shorthand
for
not
alive
die
for
become
not
alive
kill
adds
the

cause
and
suicide
adds
self
the
com
ponents
are
independent
of
the
parts
of
speech
of
the
words
to
which
they
apply
you
might
object
that
such
definitions
are
grossly
oversimplified
a
valid
concern
at
the
very
least
how
the
components
are
related
to
each
other
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
word
meaning
simplistically
adding
the
compo
nents
become
not
and
alive
together
does
not
adequately
define
die
these
issues
raise
technicalities
which
need
not
detain
us
here
for
ways
to
deal
with
them
you
might
read
work
on
this
topic
e.g
ch
of
jackendoff
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
the
universality
of
the
list
of
com
ponents
and
their
language
specific
uses
the
features
mentioned
in
table
are
quite
likely
to
be
universal
that
is
having
the
potential
to
be
used
in
the
creation
of
word
meanings
in
any
and
all
languages
while
there
may
be
com
ponents
that
are
specific
to
individual
languages
there
are
linguists
who
claim
to
have
identified
a
universal
set
of
semantic
primitives
anna
wierzbicka
probably
makes
the
strongest
claim
in
that
regard—see
wierzbicka
for
word
meaningexample
goddard
is
an
accessible
introduction
to
that
style
of
doing
semantics
while
linguists
may
claim
that
the
sets
of
primitives
they
propose
are
uni
versal
no
one
claims
that
they
are
bundled
together
in
the
same
way
in
all
languages
for
instance
while
both
english
and
french
both
make
use
of
the
component
female
they
use
it
in
different
ways
both
languages
indicate
the
female
member
of
certain
pairs
of
words
morphologically
lion
lioness
lion
lionne
however
the
two
languages
differ
in
that
french
has
separate
though
related
words
for
male
and
female
cousins
cousin
cousine
english
does
not
for
an
amusing
compilation
of
words
with
remarkable
meanings
see
de
boinod
we
must
also
distinguish
between
central
and
more
marginal
aspects
of
a
word’s
meaning
you
might
argue
that
cannibal
suggests
primitiveness
war
fare
initiation
or
absorption
of
the
characteristics
of
the
person
devoured
however
these
are
not
essential
components
of
the
meaning
of
cannibal
a
cannibal
is
still
a
cannibal
even
if
he
is
a
highly
educated
rugby
player
the
marginal
aspects
of
the
meaning
of
cannibal
can
be
regarded
as
its
conno
tations
the
connotations
of
words
are
often
variable
across
speakers
of
a
language
and
typically
express
emotional
associations
different
words
that
may
be
used
for
the
same
things
may
convey
different
feelings
about
them
for
example
woman
and
lady
may
refer
to
the
same
entities
but
they
convey
rather
different
attitudes
toward
them
exercise
a
using
the
components
in
table
and
any
others
you
might
need
identify
the
meaning
components
shared
by
the
words
in
each
of
the
sets

the
components
that
distinguish

how
effectively

ac
tually
reasonably
well
though
we
would
have
to
specify
how
the

be

we
can
use
it
to
explain
why
some

anomalous

the

the

not
animate
in

the

sleep
requires
that
its

have
the
component
animate
this
shows
that
in
addition
to
using
components
to
define
individual

also
can
be

in

of

words
are
synonymous
to
the
extent
that
they
share
components
in
simple
cases
antonyms
share
all

except
perhaps
just
one
e.g
alive
and
dead
share
the

also
has

lexical
ambiguity
is
represented
in

of

polysemy
is
explained
as
hav
ing
at
least
one
common
component
and
at

one
different

the
various
senses
of

be

which
of
the
two
approaches
to
word
meaning
is
better
one
might
favor
the
n
model
on
the
grounds
that
when
asked
for
the
meaning
of
a
word
people
tend
to
provide
synonyms
rather
than
fully
specified
definitions
as
we
saw
the
ability
to
state
adequate
definitions
is
beyond
the
capa
bilities
of
most
speakers
recall
landau’s
remark
above
psycholinguistic
experiments
likewise
favor
the
n
model
as
the
more
natural
see
aitchi

and
on
the
other
hand
there
seems
to
be
some
overlap
between
the
two
approaches
synonymy
and
antonymy
at
least
suggest
that
two
or
more
words
share
aspects
of
meaning
both
approaches
fall
short
of
fully
describing
the
meanings
of
words
the
fact
that
synonyms
are
rarely
if
ever
perfect
poses
a
challenge
to
the
n
model
and
subtle
meaning
differences
require
positing
ever
more
semantic
components
we
encourage
you
to
review
work
by
goddard
jackendoff
and
wierzbicka
for
ways
to
deal
with
such
problems
some
problems
might
be
addressed
by
combining
the
two
approaches
in
the
form
of
a
componentially-augmented
network
which
would
draw
on
the
strengths
of
both
approaches
for
example
such
an
augmented
network
model
might
allow
us
to
reduce
repetition
of
components
in
the
specifica
tions
of
related
words
for
instance
the
fact
that
anything
with
the
com
ponent
human
is
also
animate
is
a
major
redundancy
that
might
be
represented
in
people’s
minds
through
a
taxonomy
of
animate
beings
as
hyponyms
of
the
superordinate
category
of
animacy

diagrammatically

ries

for

woman
is
human
and
animate
while
armadillo
is
nonhuman
but
animate
by
virtue
of
their

with

and
by

of
the

abbreviatory
rules
like
these
are

rules
exercise
the
vast
number
of
lexical
items
in
any
language
makes
it
unlikely
that
a
small
set
of
lexical
relationships
or
components
will
suffice
to
differentiate
all
words
for
example
we
know
that
high
and
deep
have
a
great
deal
of
meaning
in
common—e.g
vertical
measurement—but
nonetheless
they
are
semantically
distinct

is
shown
by
the

b
a
the

b
the

high

and
their

are
thus
not

the

the
second

however
unable

might
be
to
articulate
this
difference
the
consistency
of
their
semantic

in

such

indicate
that
they
do
know
the

of
these

create
sentence

like
a

between
the

on
the

standard

mental

at
this
point
we
must
ask
whether
the
book
dictionaries
we
are
accustomed
to
are
accurate
models
of
the
dictionaries
we
have
in
our
minds/brains
which
allow
us
to

while
we

the

in

first
do
our
mental

use
the

strategy
as

dictionar
ies
to
allow
speedy
access
to
words
remember
that
this
is
accomplished
in
book
dictionaries
by
alphabetization
we
probably
have
between
and
words
tucked
away
in
our
minds
most
of
which
we
can
access
fairly
easily
we
can
recognize
a
word
in
about
a
fifth
of
a
second
often
even
before
we
have
heard
the
entire
word
consequently
searching
such
a
large
data
base
requires
that
it
be
structured
so
as
to
allow
rapid
searching
second
do
book

include
all
the
information
about
individual
words

the

they
enter

include
we

hyponymy
is
the
major
relation
used
by
book

to
define
words
psycholinguistic
research
shows
that
where
a
superordinate
term
is
well-established
it
comes
readily
to
mind
in
word-search
errors
and
in
word-association
tasks
however
this
research
also
shows
that
co
hypon
ymy/coordination
is
the
most
important
psychological
bond
among

in

we
have
most
of

to
have
some

not

a

where
the

falls
and
perhaps
its

the
syntactic

in

heads
is

richer
than
the
syntactic
information
in
even
the
most
elaborate
learner’s
dictionary
and
even
in
the
most
comprehensive
modern
grammar
for
example
native

book
dictionaries
typically
make
a
two-way
distinction
between
transi

and
intransitive
verbs
that
is
between
those
that
do

those
that
do
not
take

but
some
verbs
take
an
indirect
object
as
well
as
a
direct
one
e.g
give
so
the
book
dictionary
fails
to
make
a
distinc

among
verbs
that
our
mental
ones
make
in
fact
even
this
three-way
distinction
between
intransitive
transitive

barely
scratches
the
surface
of
what
we
know
about
the

book

generally
provide
no

remember
that
saying
that
one
word
is
a
hyponym
of
another
is
to
say
that
the
referents
of
the
hyponym
are
a
subset
of
the
referents
of
the
superordinate
word
another
more
contorted
way
to
say
this
is
to
say
that
the
members
of
the
category
represented
by
the
hyponym
are
a
subset
of
the
members
of
the
category
represented
by
the
superordinate
word
at
this
point
we
should
take
a
closer
look
at
how
categories
and
words
are
related
and
what
it
means
to
belong
to
a
category
we’ll
make
the
simplest
possible
assumption
about
the
relation
between
words
and
categories
words
name
categories—of
entities
events
qualities
relationships
and
the
like
one
version
of
the
traditional
school
definition
of
noun
is
a
noun
is
the
name
of
a
person
place
thing
or

one
problem
with
this
is
that
nouns
except
proper
nouns
like
all
other

name
categories
of
persons

things
and
ideas
not
just

categories
need
discussion
let’s
imagine
that
we
are
in
a
context
in
which
we
are
talking
about
technical
matters
and
that
we
are
expected
to
be
technically
correct
a
simple
example
of
such
a
context
might
be
a
discus
sion
about
plane
figures
in
a
geometry
course
in
such
a
context
when
we
use
the
word
square
we
mean
a
plane
figure
having
four
equal
sides
and
four
right
angles
wnwd
p
no
more
and
no
less
the
elements
of
the
definition
plane
figure
four
equal
sides
and
four
right
angles
are
all
necessary
to
define
square
and
together
they
are
sufficient
for
its
definition
when
scholars
try
to
define
technical
concepts
they
generally
try
to
define
them
in
terms
of
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
if
they
succeed
then
in
principle
it
is
possible
to
decide
for
any
item
whether
it
is
a
representative
of
that
category
or
not
given
our
definition
of
square
we
can
decide
for
anything
whether
it
is
a
square
or
not
the
world
however
is
not
always
as
rigid
as
a
geometry
class
imagine
now
that
we
have
been
rescued
from
the
math
discussion
and
we
go
to
a
birthday
party
where
there
is
a
flat
layer
cake
cut
into
squares
if
you
noticed
that
the
pieces
did
not
meet
the
mathematical
definition
could
you
reasonably
object
that
the
pieces
are
not
really
squares
anyone
objecting
on
those
grounds
wouldn’t
deserve
any
cake
as
far
as
we
know
there
is
no
english
word
for
the
almost
square
pieces
that
a
flat
cake
is
cut
into
so
until
someone
invents
such
a
word
and
it
is
widely
accepted
we
can
use
square
and
our
audience
will
accommodate
us
these
kinds
of
ac
commodations
lead
to
rampant
polysemy
in
much
of
the
vocabulary
so
it
is
important
to
remember
that
polysemy
accommodation
and
context
are
inextricably
intertwined
if
words
and
categories
were
all
defined
in
necessary
and
sufficient
terms
then
categories
could
be
kept
clearly
distinct
as
squares
and
triangles
are
in
geometry
but
if
we
can
bend
these
definitions
or
if
we
cannot
provide
nec
essary
and
sufficient
definitions
for
categories
then
the
boundaries
between
categories
may
get
quite
fuzzy
in
fact
many
natural
categories
are
like
this
where
exactly
does
red
end
and
orange
begin
where
do
animals
end
and
plants
begin
we
are
unlikely
to
get
unanimous
agreement
on
the
answers
to
such
questions
indeed
an
article
in
the
june
issue
of
scientific
american
grapples
with
the
problem
of
defining
species
zimmer
nonetheless
in
ordinary
non-technical
company
we
cut
each
other
some
slack
by
not
expecting
words
always
to
be
used
with
technical
rigidity
we
can
also
indicate
when
we
are
using
words
imprecisely
by
using
hedges
such
as
like
or
sort
of
or
we
can
indicate
that
we
are
being
technically
cor
rect
by
including
expressions
such
as
technically
t
echnically
a
phoneme
is
a
word
meaningcontrastive
sound
unit
many
dictionary
definitions
are
expressed
in
terms
of
the
function
that
something
serves
for
example
wnwd
defines
hinge
as
a
joint
or
device
on
which
a
door
gate
lid
etc
swings
p
suppose
that
no
one
had
oiled
the
hinge
in
decades
and
it
could
no
longer
swing—is
it
still
a
hinge
the
answer
is
undoubtedly
yes
just
as
a
dog
with
no
tail
is
still
a
dog
these
may
be
defective
members
of
their
categories
but
they
are
still
mem
bers
how
much
change
must
be
endured
before
something
is
no
longer
accepted
as
a
member
of
its
original
category
what
does
a
dog
have
to
give
up
before
it
is
no
longer
a
dog
whatever
the
answer
to
that
question
is
it
is
clear
that
we
can
adjust
our
assumptions
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
member
of
a
category
to
accommodate
defective
members
as
we
have
seen
categories
typically
have
many
members
in
fact
po
tentially
indefinitely
many
the
more
general
categories
have
multiple
sub
categories
which
in
turn
may
have
their
own
subcategories
however
some
category
members
are
viewed
as
better
members
of
the
category
than
others
for
instance
chairs
and
sofas
are
regarded
as
better
items
of
furniture
than
refrigerators
robins
and
sparrows
are
better
birds
than
penguins
or
ostrich
es
shirts
and
skirts
are
better
pieces
of
clothing
than
shoes
and
socks
this
layering
of
category
members
extends
even
to
things
defined
in
terms
of
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
such
as
prime
numbers
for
example
is
a
better
prime
number
than
even
though
both
fit
the
technical
defini
tion
it
has
been
argued
that
categories
are
structured
around
a
central
most
typical
member
or
prototype
e.g
chairs
in
the
case
of
furniture
robins
in
the
case
of
birds
and
so
on
exercise
let’s
try
to
determine
the
prototypical
member
of
a
category
as
quick
ly
as
you
can
write
out
a
list
of
ten
vegetables
then
compile
the
lists
of
all
the
students
in
your
class
order
the
vegetable
names
accord
ing
to
their
frequency
in
the
lists
then
take
the
three
most
frequent
words
and
check
how
early
they
occur
in
the
lists
generally
the
most
frequent
ones
will
occur
early
the
earliest
and
most
frequent
word
probably
represents
the
most
prototypical
member
of
the
category
of
vegetables
dictionaries
indicate
certain
aspects
of
prototypicality
in
their
defini
tions
for
example
wnwd
p
describes
a
penguin
as
a
flightless
delahunty
and
garvey
bird
this
negative
definition
suggests
that
the
typical
bird
is
not
flightless
similarly
wnwd
describes
dodoes
p
as
having
rudimentary
wings
useless
for
flying
and
ostriches
p
as
having
small
useless
wings
presumably
prototypical
wings
are
not
useless
for
flying
book
and
mental
dictionaries
differ
also
in
the
amount
of
information
they
provide
about
the
collocational
properties
of
words
for
example
if
we
leave
fat
bacon
butter
or
oil
sitting
around
long
enough
it
will
become
rancid
e.g
rancid
bacon
however
if
we
leave
fruit
vegetables
or
eggs
sit
ting
they
will
become
rotten
e.g
rotten
apple
so
rancid
collocates
with
the
words
for
fatty
or
oily
substances
and
rotten
collocates
with
words
for
fruits
vegetables
and
the
like
one
word
collocates
with
another
if
they
occur
together
in
phrases
more
frequently
than
their
meanings
alone
would
predict
for
example
green
collocates
with
envy
as
in
green
with
envy
far
more
frequently
than
other
color
names
for
example
blue
likewise
blue
collocates
with
face
as
in
blue
in
the
face
far
more
frequently
than
other
color
names
except
perhaps
for
red
as
in
red
in
the
face
so
collocations
are
relatively
predict
able
co-occurrences
of
words
in
phrases
mental
dictionaries
include
far
richer
collocational
information
than
book
dictionaries
do
the
interpretation
of
a
word
may
depend
on
what
it
collocates
with
so
dirty
means
unfair
when
it
collocates
with
fight
but
soiled
when
it
col
locates
with
clothes
and
is
ambiguous
with
hands
exercise
what
words
collocate
with
sweet
how
does
the
meaning
of
sweet
change
as
its
collocates
change
think
of
three
other
words
besides
dirty
and
sweet
and
their
collo
cates
and
describe
how
your
words
change
meaning
as
their
collocates
change
we
can
look
at
collocation
as
largely
a
matter
of
field
when
the
poly
semous
word
morphology
collocates
with
words
like
derivational
and
inflec
tional
then
we
know
we
are
in
the
field
of
linguistics
and
that
it
is
to
be
interpreted
as
denoting
word-structure
until
recently
linguists
paid
rela
tively
little
attention
to
collocation
but
with
the
development
of
very
large
computerized
databases
of
spoken
and
written
language
corpora
and
the
programs
to
search
them
concordancers
we
can
expect
collocation
to
be
word
meaningcome
an
important
area
of
research
and
to
provide
significant
insights
into
how
words
and
larger
expressions
are
organized
in
our
minds
book
diction
aries
are
more
and
more
dependent
on
such
databases
and
will
incorporate
more
collocational
information
as
time
goes
on
collocational
expectation
is
a
matter
of
degree
some
collocational
re
strictions
are
quite
narrow
others
are
more
liberal
collocates
may
become
rigidly
fixed
in
which
case
they
have
calcified
into
idioms
expressions
whose
meanings
are
not
derivable
from
their
words
and
syntax
examples
include
kick
the
bucket
for
die
tie
the
knot
for
marry
note
that
these
expressions
have
both
a
literal
and
an
idiomatic
meaning
the
audience
has
to
work
out
which
meaning
is
intended
in
a
particular
context
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
because
the
psychological
bonds
be
tween
collocates
may
be
very
strong
words
regularly
elicit
their
collocates

dictionaries

concluding
remarks
we
saw
in
this
chapter
that
dictionaries
especially
larger
more
comprehen
sive
ones
provide
enormous
amounts
of
information
about
the
words
of
a
language
we
also
saw
that
learner’s
dictionaries
tend
to
provide
more
infor
delahunty
and
garvey
mation
about
the
grammatical
structures
associated
with
individual
words
than
native-speaker
dictionaries
do
we
investigated
lexical
relations
such
as
synonymy
antonymy
hyponymy
and
the
like
and
the
ways
in
which
dictionaries
make
use
of
these
relations
in
their
definitions
our
discussion
of
mental
dictionaries
showed
that
they
are
not
alphabetically
organized
and
that
for
all
the
information
contained
in
even
the
most
comprehensive
dictionary
our
mental
dictionaries
include
even
more
information
for
each
entry
we
discovered
that
word

tend
to
be

introduction
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
that
our
discussion
of
parts
of
speech
required
us
to
consider
the
phrases
they
occurred
in
although
traditional
grammars
often
treat
word
classes
apart
from
their
roles
in
larger
structures
it
is
really
not
possible
to
do
so
for
one
thing
we
cannot
study
a
word’s
functions
without
viewing
it
in
a
larger
setting
for
another
a
single
word
may
con

a
phrase

a
noun
phrase
may
contain
just
a

likewise
a

may
contain

a
verb
phrases
then
are
units
of
one
or
more
words
they
are
the
lowest
syntactic
unit
it
is
important
for
us
to
know
about
phrases
and
to
be
able
to
distinguish
them
from
words
and
clauses
this
knowledge
is
essential
in
at
least
the
two
following
situations
journeyman
writers
often
produce
fragments
that
is
parts
of
sentences
punctuated
as
if
they
were
sentences
these
fragments
are
rarely
just
random
strings
of
words
rather
they
are
typically
internally
grammatical
they
are
in
fact
phrases
fragments
are
objected
to
because
they
are
not
the
type
of
expression
that
more
experienced
writers
would
use
in
the
context
they
are
often
a
reflection
of
linguistic
patterns
used
in
speech
and
indicate
that
the
writer
has
not
yet
mastered
the
stylistic
differences
between
the
spoken
and
written
modes
languages
differ
in
the
orders
they
impose
on
sequences
of
words
for
example
in
english
and
many
other
languages
adjectives
typically
pre
cede
the
nouns
they
modify
whereas
in
spanish
and
many
other
languag
es
adjectives
typically
follow
the
nouns
they
modify
language
learners
must
learn
the
orders
expected
in
the
target
language
their
teachers
must
know
the
ordering
possibilities
and
be
able
to
articulate
them
in
ways
their
students
can
learn
from
as
we
examine
phrases
then
we
study
how
words
relate
to
each
other
in
the
smallest
of
the
larger
linguistic
structures
in
our
chapters
on
basic
delahunty
and
garvey
clause
patterns
and
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
we
examine
the
ways
in
which
phrases
form
clauses
our
discussion
here
will
treat
the
five
major

types
in
english

we
will
discuss
each
of
the
five
types
in
a
similar
way
first
we
will
exam
ine
their
basic
functional
patterns
then
how
those
functions
are
realized
by
structural
possibilities
and
where
appropriate
we
will
explore
some
of
the
complexities
associated
with
each
type
of
phrase
whenever
such
complexi
ties
lead
us
to
topics
considered
in
another
chapter
we
will
provide
a
brief
commentary
and
defer
fuller
treatment
to
a
later
time
what
is
a
phrase
t
raditionally
phrase
is
defined
as
a
group
of
words
that
does
not
contain
a
verb
and
its
subject
and
is
used
as
a
single
part
of
speech
this
definition
entails
three
characteristics
it
specifies
that
only
a
group
of
words
can
constitute
a
phrase
implying
that
a
single
word
cannot
it
distinguishes
phrases
from
clauses
and
it
requires
that
the
groups
of
words
believed
to
be
a
phrase
constitute
a
single
grammatical
unit
we
accept
and
but
must
revise
we
reject
the
claim
that
single
words
cannot
constitute
phrases
first
a
word
and
a
phrase
may
play
identical
grammatical
roles
in
a
clause
as
and
demonstrate
most
of
the
members
of
the
genus
avis
fly
birds
fly
most
of
the
members
of
the
genus
avis
is
the
subject
of
and
birds
is
the
sub
ject
of
showing
that
single
words
and
phrases
can
function
identically
in
clauses
there
are
two
inferences
that
we
can
draw
from
this
fact
a
a
subject
can
consist
of
either
a
single
noun
or
a
noun
phrase
or
b
subjects
are
phrases
and
so
whatever
functions
as
a
subject
must
be
a
phrase
if
we
assume
a
then
whenever
we
define
subject
and
any
other
grammatical
function
such
as
predicate
direct
object
indirect
object
etc
we
must
always
specify
that
it
can
be
expressed
as
a
word
or
as
a
phrase
linguists
phraseswould
say
that
this
formulation
is
more
complex
than
it
needs
to
be
because
it
fails
to
articulate
a
more
general
pattern
the
broader
generalization
is
that
these
grammatical
relations
are
always
expressed
as
phrases
and
phrases
can
consist
of
either
a
single
word
or
a
unified
group
of
words
below
we
will
show
how
and
when
words
can
be
phrases
second
single
words
and
phrases
may
be
replaced
by
identical
proforms
we
can
replace
the
subjects
of
both
and
with
they
a
they
fly
a
they
fly
again
there
are
two
inferences
we
can
draw
a
pronouns
can
replace
ei
ther
a
noun
or
a
noun
phrase
or
b
pronouns
replace
phrases
again
b
is
more
general
but
it
does
require
us
to
specify
when
words
can
function
as
phrases
a
single
word
may
be
a
phrase
when
it
is
the
head
of
that
phrase
the
head
of
a
phrase
is
the
phrase’s
central
element
any
other
words
or
phrases
in
the
phrase
orient
to
it
either
by
modifying
it
or
complementing
it
the
head
determines
the
phrase’s
grammatical
category
if
the
head
is
a
noun
the
phrase
is
a
noun
phrase
if
the
head
is
a
verb
the
phrase
is
a
verb
phrase
and
so
on
the
head
can
also
determine
the
internal
grammar
of
the
phrase
if
the
head
is
a
noun
then
it
may
be
modified
by
an
article
if
the
head
is
a
transitive
verb
it
must
be
complemented
by
a
direct
object
heads
also
determine
such
things
as
the
number
of
their
phrases
if
the
head
of
an
np
is
singular
then
the
np
is
singular
if
the
head
is
plural
then
the
np
is
plural
crucially
the
head
of
a
phrase
may
occur
alone
in
the
phrase
that
is
without
modification
or
complementation
let’s
look
a
little
closer
at
what
expressions
may
be
replaced
by
pronouns
specifically
let’s
test
the
claim
made
in
many
textbooks
that
pronouns
can
replace
nouns
or
noun
phrases
consider
fooster
hates
the
cabbage
np
det
n
the
cabbage
if
we
replace
the
np
the
cabbage
in
with
the
pronoun
it
we
get
the
per
fectly
grammatical
a
delahunty
and
garvey
a
fooster
hates
it
np
pron
it
however
given
the
typical
textbook
definition
of
pronoun
as
a
word
that
can
replace
either
nouns
or
noun
phrases
we
should
be
able
to
replace
just
the
noun
cabbage
in
with
it
however
when
we
do
so
we
create
the
wildly
ungrammatical
b
b
fooster
hates
the
it
so
why
is
a
fine
but
b
is
not
to
create
a
we
replaced
the
entire
phrase
the
cabbage
but
for
b
we
replaced
only
a
part
of
the
phrase
it
ap
pears
that
when
we
pronominalize
we
must
replace
an
entire
phrase
with
a
pronoun
not
just
a
random
piece
of
it
it
follows
that
if
we
can
successfully
replace
an
expression
with
a
pronoun
then
that
expression
must
be
a
com
plete
phrase
to
check
this
consider
what
happens
when
we
replace
cabbage
in
c
with
a
pronoun
we
get
the
grammatical
d
c
fooster
hates
cabbage
np
d
fooster
hates
it
n
cabbage
so
cabbage
is
just
a
noun
in
and
therefore
cannot
be
replaced
by
a
pro
noun
but
in
c
it
is
both
a
noun
and
a
noun
phrase
as
the
diagram
shows
and
so
can
be
pronominalized
proved
by
the
fact
that
d
is
gram
matical
let’s
add
just
one
more
test
to
the
two
tests
for
phrasehood
we’ve
already
used
capable
of
functioning
as
a
grammatical
relation
and
capable
of
being
replaced
by
a
pronoun
if
an
expression
can
be
moved
from
one
part
of
a
sentence
to
another
without
any
internal
reorganization
then
that
expres
sion
is
a
phrase
we
can
use
our
cabbage
sentences
for
this
test
too
we
can
successfully
move
the
cabbage
in
to
the
left
of
the
subject
giv
ing
us
e
the
cabbage
fooster
hates
phrases
but
when
we
try
to
move
just
the
n
cabbage
the
result
is
ungrammatical
just
as
when
we
tried
to
pronominalize
cabbage
in
f
cabbage
fooster
hates
the
analogously
when
we
move
cabbage
in
c
in
which
cabbage
occurs
alone
the
result
is
also
grammatical
g
cabbage
fooster
hates
so
we’ve
applied
three
tests—ability
to
function
as
a
grammatical
rela
tion
pronominalization
and
movement—and
all
three
have
yielded
the
same
results
a
phrase
may
consist
of
a
unified
group
of
words
or
of
a
single
word
as
long
as
that
word
is
the
phrase’s
head
there
is
an
important
methodological
precept
here
the
more
arguments
you
can
marshal
in
favor
of
your
analysis
and
definitions
the
more
confi
dence
you
can
place
in
them
our
new
improved
definition
of
phrase
a
phrase
is
a
grammatical
unit
intermediate
between
a
word
and
a
clause
which
may
consist
of
just
one
word
its
head
or
its
head
and
expressions
including
other
phrases
that
modify
or
complement
it
see
below
this
definition
retains
the
traditional
distinc
tions
between
word
and
phrase
and
between
phrase
and
clause
it
adds
the
requirement
that
phrases
have
heads
and
allows
a
phrase
to
consist
of
just
its
head
in
considering
word
classes
we
examined
the
most
important
ones
first
in
this
chapter
we
will
present
the
three
less
complex
types
first
adverb
prepositional
and
adjective
the
reason
for
this
seemingly
backwards
ap
proach
is
that
the
two
major
phrase
types
noun
phrases
and
verb
phras
es—often
include
the
minor
types
as
subparts
but
first
we
must
make
a
brief
detour
to
discuss
the
important
distinction
between
modification
and
complementation
modification
and
complementation
the
head
of
a
phrase
may
be
modified
or
complemented
by
other
words
phrases
or
sentences
within
the
phrase
we
begin
with
complementation
as
it
is
perhaps
the
more
easily
understood
when
one
element
in
an
expression
creates
the
grammatical
expectation
that
another
expression
will
also
occur
the
expected
element
complements
the
expecting
element
for
example
transitive
verbs
create
the
expectation
of
an
object
as
in
sheila
fractured
her
ankle
bitransitive
verbs
create
the
delahunty
and
garvey
expectation
of
two
objects
as
in
sally
gave
her
a
shot
of
morphine
certain
other
verbs
create
the
expectation
of
two
complements
though
one
or
both
need
not
be
an
np
as
in
she
put
her
first
aid
kit
away/in
the
truck
gener
ally
although
verbs
in
english
require
a
subject
subjects
are
not
usually
said
to
complement
the
verb
verbs
are
the
primary
complement-requiring
elements
in
language
but
other
parts
of
speech
may
require
complements
too
prepositions
typically
require
an
np
complement
on
may
be
complemented
by
a
phrase
denot
ing
notions
such
as
location
or
time
as
in
on
the
pavement
on
your
mark
on
time
certain
nouns
may
be
complemented
by
clauses
as
in
the
belief
that
diseases
are
caused
by
evil
spirits
modification
occurs
in
a
construction
in
which
an
expression
is
accom
panied
by
an
element
not
grammatically
required
by
it
for
example
be
cause
nouns
do
not
typically
require
adjectives
eager
modifies
fans
in
eager
fans
verbs
and
adjectives
do
not
typically
require
that
they
be
accompanied
by
adverbials
so
violently
modifies
swore
in
swore
violently
and
disappoint
ingly
modifies
slow
in
disappointingly
slow
modification
may
be
restrictive
or
non-restrictive
when
one
word
re
strictively
modifies
another
the
modifier
restricts
the
potential
reference
of
the
modified
for
example
in
the
phrase
long
books
the
adjective
long
re
strictively
modifies
the
noun
books
if
the
word
books
were
to
occur
alone
then
it
could
potentially
refer
to
any
and
all
types
of
books
the
modifier
restricts
the
reference
of
the
phrase
to
just
those
books
that
are
long
nouns
may
have
many
modifiers
as
in
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
short
haired
cat
here
we
have
six
modifiers
each
restricting
the
potential
refer
ence
of
the
word
cat
the
result
of
piling
up
these
modifiers
is
that
the
actual
referent
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
all
of
them—it
must
be
a
cat
that
is
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
and
short-haired
each
modifier
acts
like
a
criterion
that
the
ultimate
referent(s
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
there
are
two
main
classes
of
modifying
words
in
english—adjectives
and
adverbs
adjectives
modify
nouns
and
adverbs
modify
pretty
much
ev
erything
else—verbs
adjectives
other
adverbs
and
sentences
they
modify
these
in
much
the
same
way
as
adjectives
modify
nouns—by
adding
criteria
that
must
be
met
for
example
in
ran
quickly
quickly
modifies
ran
and
therefore
requires
that
whoever
ran
didn’t
run
in
any
old
way
but
did
it
quickly
other
examples
include
expressions
like
take
regularly
needs
help
immediately
likewise
intensely
in
intensely
bright
requires
that
the
bright
ness
be
intense
cf
specially
packaged
medically
appropriate
irritatingly
in
irritatingly
slowly
requires
that
whatever
is
going
on
must
not
only
be
going
on
slowly
but
so
slowly
as
to
be
irritating
to
someone
cf
extremely
cleverly
phrasesunfortunately
in
unfortunately
he
didn’t
make
it
back
requires
not
only
that
he
didn’t
make
it
back
but
also
that
the
speaker
feels
that
it
is
unfortunate
that
he
didn’t
cf
sadly
she’s
no
longer
with
us
hopefully
it
won’t

again
nouns
may
be
restrictively
modified
by
clauses
called
relative
adjective
or
defining
clauses
bolded
in

man
who
knew
too
much
notice
that
there
is
no
comma
between
the
noun
man
and
the
beginning
of
the
re
strictive
relative
clause
sentences
may
be
restrictively
modified
by
adverbial
clauses
bolded
in
though
he
liked
her
a
lot
he
was
afraid
to
ask
her
for

here
a
comma
is
preferred
especially
if
the
adverbial
clause
is
relatively
long
notice
that
none
of
the
modifiers
are
required
or
implied
by
the
words
phrases
or
sentences
they
modify
these
words
phrases
and
sentences
would
be
grammatically
complete
without
the
modifiers—though
of
course
adding
or
removing
modifiers
affects
the
meaning
and
potential
referents
of
the
modified
elements
non-restrictive
modifiers
or
appositives
add
information
that
is
not
essential
for
the
identification
of
the
referent
of
the
phrase
so
modified
in
written
english
appositives
are
set
off
by
commas
the
president
of
the
us
who
is
in
his
th
year
in
office
has
only
one
more
year
to
serve
in
cases
like
this
the
writer
assumes
that
the
reader
will
know
who
the
president
of
the
us
is
and
so
does
not
need
the
appositive
information
to
identify
him
nonetheless
the
writer
adds
the
information
that
the
president
is
in
his
th
year
in
office
as
a
sort
of
secondary
predicate
in
addition
to
the
primary
one
namely
that
he
has
only
one
more
year
to
serve
in
spoken
english
appositives
are
set
off
from
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
by
brief
pauses
hence
the
commas
and
a
drop
in
pitch
from
a
writer’s
or
speaker’s
point
of
view
it
is
essential
to
decide
whether
the
audience
does
or
does
not
need

to
adverb

and
all
other
expression
types
that
function
in
the
ways
that
adverb

do
namely
as
modifiers
of
almost
all

of

nouns

the

prepositions
presented

phrases
prepositional

constructions
spot

the
np
that
immediately
follows
it
and
you
can
be
fairly
certain
that
you
have
identified

pp
however
you
should
recall
that
some
apparent
prepositions
are
actually
particles

that
others

none
it
may
seem
odd
to
treat
a
preposition
as
the
head
of
a
phrase
because
traditional
grammar
may
have
persuaded
us
to
regard
the
preposition
as
in
significant
in
fact
prepositions
express
meanings
that
encompass
the
entire
range
of
key
semantic
relations
in
a
sentence
another
sign
of
the
importance
of
prepositional
phrases
is
their
ability
to
appear
in
so
many
structures—with
in
noun
phrases
verb
phrases
and
adjective
phrases
the
second
part
of
the
pp
is
a
noun
phrase
that
functions
as
its
comple

object
this
terminology
also
suggests
the
central
role
of
the

prepositions
are
often
simply
characterized
as
linking
words
and
this
is
an
accurate
characterization
as
far
as
it
goes
however
we’d
like
to
have
a
more
complete
concept
of
how
they
work
typically
prepositions
have
phrasesmeanings
and
these
meanings
connect
their
objects
to
other
parts
of
the
sentences
in
which
they
occur

in

notions
such

recipient

in

let’s
refer
to
them
all
as
nomi

every
np
like
every
other
phrase
must
have
a
head
and
any
nominal
can
be
the

we
begin
this

by
presenting
two
very
general
functional
formulas

give
these

because
it
would
be
confusing
to

them
into

a

postmodifier

formula
a
states
that
a
noun

must
contain
a
head
word
which
of
course
must
be
a
nominal
but
need
not
contain
anything
else
if
the
np
has
more
elements
than
the

it
may
contain

modifiers
that
precede
the
head
and/or
one

more
postmodi

the

the

which
we
briefly
discussed
in

chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
here
we
will
elaborate
on
that
discussion
we
noted
that
one
major
use
of
an
article
is
to
indicate
whether
the
np
in
which
it
occurs
is
definite
or
not
if
the
np
is
definite
then
the
speaker
writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
can
identify
the
referent
of
the
np
and
if
the
np
is
indefinite
then
the
speaker/writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
phrasescannot
identify
its
referent
yet
another
meaning
associated
with
nps
is
that
of
referentiality
a
referring
np
may
be
either
definite
or
indefinite
but
it
denotes
a
particular
entity
or
set
of
entities
the
bold
np

the/a
man
sat
down

to
some
particular
man
the
opposite
of
a
referring
np
is
an
attributive
or
non-referring
one
an
attributive

a
description

not
refer
to
any
particular
individual(s
anyone

anything

a
problem
that
arises
with
expressions
in
which
a
n
is
followed
by
a
pp
is
whether
the
n
and
pp
actually
combine
to
form
a
noun
phrase
as
in
the
examples
in
or
whether
they
are
simply
a
non-unified
sequence
of
n
followed
by
pp
as
in

the

on

in
this
expression
the
n
book
is
not
combined
with
the
pp
on

into
an

it
is
important
to
have
ways
of
identifying
which
kind
of
expression
we
are
dealing
with
remember
that
we
said
that
one
test
for
phrasehood
is
the
possibility
of
being
replaced
by
a
single
word
in
the
case
of
nps
these
words
would
be
pronouns
so
if
a
sequence
of
words
can
be
replaced
by
a
pronoun
then
it
is
very
likely
an
np
for
instance
you
could
replace
all
of
the
expressions
in
by
some
form
of
the
word
they
let’s
call
this
test
the
pronoun-substitution
pro-sub
t
est
to
see
how
it
works
let’s
consider
a
woody
admired
the
picture
on
the
wall
b
woody
put
the
picture
on
the
wall
delahunty
and
garvey
applying
the
pro-sub
test
to
the
picture
on
the
wall
in
a
we
get
a
a
woody
admired
it
this
is
grammatical
so
in
a
the
picture
on
the
wall
is
a
unified
np
when
we
apply
the
pro-sub
test
to
the
same
sequence
of
words
in
b
we
get
b
b
woody
put
it
this
is
ungrammatical
showing
us
that
the
picture
on
the

in
b
is
not
a
unified
np
if
we
now
apply
the
pro-sub
test
to
the
picture
in
b
we
get
woody
put
it
on
the
wall
this
is
grammatical
showing
us
that
the
picture
in
b
is
separate
from
on
the
wall
these
patterns
of
grammaticality
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
contains
an
np
made
up
of
a
head
with
a
pp
postmodifier
and
that
b
contains
the
simpler

thus
that
the

the

thus
that

we
can
conclude
that
the

two
further
issues

these
examples
indicate
that
the
choice
of
premodifier
genitive
vs
of-geni
tive
depends
on
various
factors
a
the
length
of
the
gennp
the
longer
the
gennp
the
more
like
ly
we
are
to
use
an
of-genitive
e.g
e
b
whether
the
entity
represented
by
the
genitive
is
animate
or
not
if
it
is
we
are
more
likely
to
use
the
premodifier
genitive
cf
the
cat’s
fur
vs
the
wheel’s
rim
c
if
the
gennp
is
a
pronoun
we
strongly
prefer
the
premodifier
genitive
cf
her
car
vs
the
car
of
her
sophie’s
choice
vs
a
choice
of
sophie(’s
d
note
the
meaning
difference
between
her
photographs
and
photo
graphs
of
her
the
first
can
have
many
meanings
e.g
photographs
she
owns/took/ordered/designed/etc
the
second
means
photo
graphs
in
which
she
is
pictured
e
an
np
containing
a
premodifier
genitive
is
definite
but
a
post
phrasesmodifier
genitive
allows
indefinite
determiners
to
modify
the
head
noun
compare
the
definite
np
oscar’s
friend
with
the
in
definite
np
a
friend
of
oscar’s
while
native
speakers
are
not
likely
to
have
trouble
with
such
complexi
ties
non-native
students
may
encounter
serious
difficulties
with
this
con
struction
the
second
complexity
is
that
genitive
nps
themselves
contain
a
np
when
one
structure
contains
another
structure
we
say
that
the
second
structure
is
embedded
in
the
first
the
np
harry’s
wife’s
paintings
contains
a
genitive
np
within
a
genitive
np
in
other
words
harry’s
is
embedded
within
harry’s
wife’s
which
in
turn
is
embedded
in
harry’s

this

embedding
allows
one
function
or
form
to
contain
other
functions
or
forms
an
understanding
of
embedding
is
critical
to
analysis
of
grammatical
structures
with
any
significant
degree
of
complexity
let’s
illustrate
this
fact
with
diagram
np-l
harry’s

consists
of
a
premodifier
of
the
form
gennp
harry’s

the

no
premodifiers
delahunty

under

we
could
have
chosen
a
premodifier
with
a
possessive
pro

and
a

to
give
us
my
uncle
harry’s

we
could
even
have
selected
another
gennp
under

in
which
case
we
might
have
gotten
harry’s

in

we
could
in

embedding
enables

to
be
infinite
in
the
number
and
length
of
the
sentences
it
can
create
fortunately
speakers
tend
to
use
these
possi
bilities
sparingly
though
occasionally
writers
such
as
dylan
thomas
henry
james
and
william
faulkner
toy
with
them
as
you
progress
through
this
book
you
will
see
the
pervasiveness
of
embedding
before
we
leave
premodifiers
of
ns
we
must
address
one
final
matter
namely
the
order
of
premodifiers
there
are
many
proposals
in
the
gram
matical

linguistic
literature
many
of
remarkable

may
come
up
with

that
violate
the

the
various
sorts
of

we
have
already
examined
the

the
simplest

yet
even
this
innocent
construc

raises
the
specter
of
mind-boggling
expansions
like

is
due
also

the
potential

in

here
we

derived
from

these
derived
nouns
can
head
noun
phrases
just
like
any
other

however
their
relationship
to
verbs
allows
them
to
have
subjects
and
objects
for
example
amusement
is
derived
from
amuse
which
is
a
transitive
verb
and
so
grammatical
in
a
sentence
with
both
a
subject

a
direct

such
as

that
in

the

up
as
a
genitive
premodifier
the
clown’s
and
that
the
direct
object
of
the

in

the

shows
up
as

old

old

the

to
the

four
potential

whether
another

what
can
we
learn
from
this
odd
pattern
of
sentences
first
when
do
occurs
phraseswith
a
main
verb
that
verb
is
in
its
base
v
form
represented
by
the
formu
la
do
v
second
do
cannot
occur
with
any
of
the
other
auxiliaries
either
before
or
after
them
third
do
may
occur
when
the
main
verb
is
negated
by
not
or
n’t
a
in
a
question
b
or
in
an
emphatic
sentence
c
fourth
the
auxiliary
do
differs
from
the
pro-verb
phrase
do
consider
sentence
did
she
do
so
too
in
this
example
did
is
an
auxiliary
while
do
so
acts
as
a
pro-verb
phrase
an
expression
that
substitutes
for
a
verb
phrase
auxiliary
do
and
main
verb
do
also
differ
as
the
fact
that
they
can
co
occur

one
handy
test
for
identifying
vps
is
the
do-so
t
est
one
simple
ap
plication
of
this
test
is
to
substitute
do
so
for
the
vp
ensuring
that
the
tense
of
do
matches
that
of
the
original

c
hector
has
never

c
d
hector
does
not
do
so
d
e
hector
has
been
doing
so
e
in
another
version
of
this
test
the
sentence
in
question
is
coordinated
with
one
similar
to
it
in
this
case
the
elements
reverse
to
form
so
do
a
hector
juggles

so
does
zenobia
b
all
the
employees
agree

so
does
their
supervisor
c
the

in
short
the
expressions

so
and
so
do

its

vp
head
object(s
complement
a
phrase
that
obligatorily
follows
a
verb
head
is
called
an
object
or
comple
ment
these
terms
are
sometimes
interchangeable
although
tradition
has
tended
to
attach
object
to
some
constructions
and
complement
to
oth
ers
the
reasons
for
the
variation
are
obscure
the
label
object
dimly
sug
gests
the
goal
or
purpose
of
the
verb
head
though
neither
of
these
semantic
labels
applies
to
every
structure
so
labeled
the
term
complement
suggests
the
notion
of
completing
hence
the
spelling
the
verb
in
some
way
table
lists
the
four
main
types
of
objects
and
complements
type
example
direct

s
table
objects
and
complements
of
verbs
table
reveals
that
nps
can
serve
any
object
or
complement
function
that
adjective
phrases
can
also
act
in
complement
functions
and
that
an
entire
clause
or
sentence
can
act
as
the
complement
of
certain
verbs
an
important
grammatical
notion
associated
with
the
direct
object
is
that
of
transitivity
a
transitive
verb
takes
a
direct
object
an
intransitive
verb
does
not
thus
the
sentences
a-d
contain
transitive
verbs
and
those
in
a-d
contain
intransitive
verbs
the
direct
objects
in
are
italicized
a
moriarty
eluded
sherlock
b
everyone

c
sarah

a

phrases
b

c

d
everyone

room

in
english
a
large
number
of
verbs
can
be
either
transitive
or
intransitive
sometimes
with
a
considerable
difference
of
meaning
a
the
fire
smoked
b
shelley
smoked
ambiguous
c
shelley
smoked
the
salmon
thus
whether
such
verbs
are
transitive
or
intransitive
can
only
be
deter
mined
by
their
use
in
an
actual
clause
one
simple
test
is
that
an
intransitive
verb
can
potentially
end
a
complete
clause
as
in
t
wo
structures
require
not
one
but
two
phrases
to
follow
the
verb
the
indirect
object
construction
e.g
c
typically
calls
for
a
direct
object
also
verbs
that
enter
into
such
constructions
are
said
to
be
bitransitive
or
ditransitive
the
object
complement
construction
e.g
d
requires
a
direct
object
preceding
the
complement
we
deal
in
more
detail
with
these
constructions
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
verbs
with
objects
may
imply
end
products
and/or
bounded
activities
a

built
a

a
implies
that
a
workbench

the
build
ing
it
also
views
the
workbench
building
event
as
having
an
end
point
namely
the
completion
of
the
workbench
b
is
in
the
simple
present
tense
and
represents
multiple
discrete
workbench
building
events
as
the
plural
workbenches
makes
clear
in
this
respect
it
is
like
a
punctual
verb
such
as
cough
punch
or
kick
verbs
without
objects
often
imply
no
natural
end-point
compare
a

b
a

b

no
particular

she’s
still
running
b
on
the

introduction
until
now
we
have
examined
the
grammar
of
english
in
bits
and
piec
es—phonemes
morphemes
words
and
phrases
in
this
chapter
we
put
these
pieces
together
into
the
basic
grammatical
structure
of
language—the
clause
clauses
are
basic
for
several
reasons
first
you
need
only
one
of
them
to
make
a
sentence
though
of
course
sentences
may
consist
of
an
indefinite
number
of
clauses
second
in
actual
communication
shorter
ut
terances
are
usually
reconstructed
and
understood
by
reference
to
clauses
for
instance
over
here
might
be
understood
as
i’m
over
here
or
shine
the
light
over
here
the
grammatical
importance
of
clauses
probably
reflects
the
fact
that
the
clause
most
directly
represents
the
most
fundamental
structure
of
meaning—the
proposition
a
description
of
a
state
of
affairs
whose
truth
may
be
asserted
questioned
or
otherwise
manipulated
it
doesn’t
make
much
sense
to
say
that
a
clause
represents
a
complete
thought
as
school
grammars
often
do
unless
we
know
what
a
complete
thought
is
a
proposi
tion
is
the
best
model
of
a
complete
thought
whatever
it
is
that
we
have
for
the
present
we
will
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
sense
of
clause
hood
is
intuitive
based
on
our
competence
as
native
speakers
and
perhaps
on
our
status
as
human
makers
of
meaning
although
students
may
need
practice
in
identifying
clauses
of
the
many
reasons
why
we
should
know
about
clauses
we’ll
briefly
discuss
just
four
first
clauses
are
an
important
punctuation
unit
when
a
clause
constitutes
a
whole
sentence
in
written
english
it
must
begin
with
a
capital
letter
and
end
in
a
period
or
its
equivalent
when
multiple
clauses
combine
to
constitute
a
sentence
the
individual
clauses
may
require
spe
cial
punctuation
such
as
separation
by
commas
certainly
the
single
clause
sentence
is
the
best
unit
to
begin
teaching
punctuation
with
second
and
relatedly
writing
teachers
are
concerned
about
sentence
fragments
that
is
non-sentential
units
improperly
punctuated
as
sentential
delahunty
and
garvey
units
as
we
noted
earlier
fragments
are
typically
internally
grammatical
that
is
they
are
well-formed
phrases
or
clauses
students
must
learn
the
differences
between
clauses
and
their
constituent
units
and
between
clauses
and
sentences
in
order
to
learn
to
punctuate
appropriately
third
a
developed
writing
style
requires
control
of
a
range
of
sentence
types
from
sentences
with
just
a
single
clause
through
sentences
with
an
indefinite
number
of
clauses
a
traditional
technique
for
helping
student
writers
expand
their
repertoires
is
sentence
combining
or
more
accurately
clause
combining
teachers
wishing
to
create
clause
combining
exercises
for
their
students
must
know
about
clauses
especially
if
they
want
to
tai
lor
the
exercises
to
their
students’
actual
needs
fourth
an
important
aspect
of
standard
english
grammar
is
subject
verb
agreement
that
is
the
subject
and
verb
of
a
clause
must
grammati
cally
agree
with
each
other
in
person
and
number
in
order
to
be
able
to
teach
subject
verb
agreement
teachers
must
know
about
subjects
verbs
and
clauses
and
while
the
general
agreement
principle
is
quite
simple
it
is
quite
intricate
in
its
details
which
we
deal
with
in
our
chapter
on
usage
in
book
ii
in
this
chapter
we
first
examine
the
internal
organization
of
clauses
next
we
discuss
the
subject
function
illustrating
the
use
of
formal
characteristics
to
identify
it
we
then
discuss
the
semantic
roles
subjects
and
other
phrases
may
play
in
clauses
the
main
part
of
the
chapter
provides
details
on
seven
major
clause
patterns
in
the
language
elements
of
the
clause
the
basic
functional
analysis
of
a
clause
is
very
simple
a
clause
is
a
grammatical
unit
that
contains
a
subject
and
a
predi
cate
that’s
all
only
a
subject
and
a
predicate
are
needed
no
less
than
a
subject
and
a
predicate
will
do
recall
our
discussion
of
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
according
to
this
definition
all
of
the
expressions
in
are
clauses
subjects
are
italicized
predicates

the

are
discussed
in
our
chapter
on

the

as
the
subject
of
its
clause
while
the
vp
functions
as
the
predicate
we
deal
with
subjects
in
our
subjects
section
and
with
predicates
in
our
basic
clause
patterns
section
later
in
this
chapter
as
we
go
along
we
will
introduce
complexities
to
the
diagramming
systems
as
needed
in
contrast
to
the
expressions
in
those

the
fact
that
a
group
of
words
has
a
certain
length
or
can
be
understood
in
some
context
is
inadequate
to
define
a
clause
b
for
example
contains
more
words
than
a,d
or
e
likewise
over
here
can
be
understood
if
one
imagines
a
context
clause
patterns
provide
the
basic
skeletons
of
english
sentences
full
sentences
consist
of
clause
patterns
either
minimally
or
extensively
devel
delahunty
and
garvey
oped—through
expansion
of
their
component
phrases
and/or
by
including
more
than
one
clause
in
the
following
pages
we
will
consider
first
the
subject
function
in
ways
that
will
apply
to
all
basic
clause
patterns
we
will
indicate
the
fundamen
tal
forms
of
subjects
and
then
their
meanings
stated
in
terms
of
semantic
roles
we
will
then
turn
to
the
various
types
of
predicates
pointing
out
their
functional
and
formal
characteristics
since
different
patterns
have
differing
types
of
objects
and
complements
we
will
describe
each
pattern
in
a
way
that
expands
slightly
on
the
simple
subject
predicate
division
subjects
the
traditional
definition
of
subject
is
what
the
sentence
is
about
a.k.a
the
topic
of
the
sentence
a
traditional
grammarian
would
say
that
sentence
is
about
oscar
oscar
willed
elmer
his
worm-farm
what
it
says
about
him
is
that
he
willed
elmer
his
worm-farm
predicates
from
a
traditional
point
of
view
complete
a
sentence
by
saying
something
about
its
subject
this
function
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
comment
of
the
sentence
subjects
tend
to
refer
to
entities
that
are
assumed
to
be
already
familiar
to
the
hearer
they
often
represent
what
has
been
variously
referred
to
as
known
old
or
given
information
predicates
generally
contain
the
new
informa
tion
in
a
sentence
the
traditional
definition
of
subject
is
neither
a
formal
functional
nor
semantic
one
rather
it
defines
a
subject
in
terms
of
how
the
sentence
in
which
it
appears
relates
to
the
ongoing
play
of
meaning
in
a
discourse
unfortunately
unless
we
have
a
way
to
accurately
identify
what
a
sentence
is
about
this
definition
is
unusable
and
even
when
we
can
reliably
identify
what
a
sentence
is
about
the
definition
may
give
incorrect
results
as
in
and
speaking
of
subjects
we
should
identify
them
formally
in
given
the
appropriate
context
we
might
argue
that
and
speaking
of
is
a
marker
of
topichood
and
so
the
topic
of
is
the
phrase
subjects
though
subjects
is
not
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
shift
from
grammar
to
discourse
is
particularly
serious
when
we
look
at
more
complicated
sentences
such
as
basic
clause
patterns
whenever
you
feel
like
raking
those
leaves
go
ahead
and
do
it
because
i
won’t
rake
them
what
is
the
topic
of
this
sentence
raking
the
leaves
if
so
it
isn’t
a
subject
if
only
subjects
can
qualify
as
topics
then
either
you
or
i
or
both
must
be
its
topics
can
a
sentence
have
two
topics
the
traditional
definition
doesn’t
say
is
every
subject
a
topic
the
traditional
definition
doesn’t
say
if
every
sub
ject
is
not
a
topic
how
do
you
identify
the
topic
the
traditional
definition
doesn’t
say
in
short
one
cannot
identify
topics
of
sentences
out
of
context
and
when
we
examine
sentences
in
context
the
topics
may
well
turn
out
not
to
be
subjects
thus
the
traditional
discourse-based
criterion
for
establishing
a
grammatical
category
reflects
a
mistaken
notion
of
grammatical
criteria
and
it
just
doesn’t
work
exercise
using
only
the
traditional
definition
of
subject
try
to
identify
the
whole
subjects
of
the
following
sentences
a
oscar
closed
the
door
b
amanda
helped
herself
to
the
nectarines
c
one
usually
takes
a
long
time
to
recover
from
a
back
injury
d
no
one
understands
me
e
advantage
was
taken
of
the
loophole
by
the
cabinet
ministers
f
it
is
clear
that
power
breeds
corruption
g
it
rained
yesterday
h
there
will
be
more
rain
tomorrow
what
kinds
of
problems
did
you
run
into
besides
the
definition
what
assumptions
did
you
have
to
make
identifying
a
subject
in
this
section
we
present
a
formal
characterization
of
subject
to
replace
the
definition
based
on
discourse
function
we
can
provide
a
more
accurate
and
more
general
characterization
by
using
the
position
agreement
patterns
and
case
markings
of
subjects
in
clauses
consider
the
following
sentences
a
i
am
at
home
b
you
are
at
home
c
he/she/it
is
at
home
d
we/you/they
are
at
home
delahunty
and
garvey
there
would
be
universal
agreement
that
the
subjects
of
the
clauses
in
are
the
pronouns
i
you
etc
from
these
simple
clauses
we
can
derive
a
general
pattern
namely
that
an
english
subject
typically
occurs
more
or
less
immedi
ately
before
the
verb
of
its
clause
exercise
using
only
the
fact
that
an
english
subject
occurs
more
or
less
imme
diately
before
the
verb(s
of
its
clause
identify
the
whole
subject
of
each
of
the
following
sentences
a
oscar
made
most
of
the
children
laugh
most
of
the
time
b
many
deer
are
killed
on
the
roads
each

great
skill
and
daring
quickly

from
the
web

g
rarely

been
so
disgusted
h
there
are
a
number
of
rhetorical
problems
here
what
problems
did
you
run
into
and
how
did
you
solve
them
from
our
discussion
of
pronouns
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
we
hope
you
remember
that
pronouns
if
they
replace
anything
replace
entire
noun
phrases
it
follows
that
if
we
replace
the
pronouns
in
with
more
complex
nps
then
those
more
complex
nps
bolded
must
also
be
the
subjects
of
their
clauses
a
olive
is
at
home
b
olive
and
popeye
are
at
home
c
the
one
you’re
looking
for
is
at
home
d
all
the
little
children
are
at
home
many
school
grammars
writing
manuals
and
composition
textbooks
identify
the
head
of
the
subject
phrase
as
the
subject
of
the
clause
some
texts
are
more
careful
and
distinguish
the
simple
subject
from
the
whole
subject
by
simple
subject
they
mean
the
head
of
the
subject
phrase
logi
cally
however
if
a
pronoun
is
the
subject
of
a
clause
then
any
expression
regardless
of
how
complex
that
replaces
the
pronoun
must
also
be
the
sub
basic
clause
patternsject
of
that
clause
we
will
follow
the
practice
of
linguists
when
we
speak
of
the
subject
of
a
clause
we
mean
the
entire
subject
if
we
wish
to
refer
to
the
head
of
the
subject
then
we
will
speak
of
the
head
of
subject
we
will
not
use
the
terms
simple
subject
nor
will
we
ever
use
the
term
subject
to
refer
just
to
head
of
the
subject
similar
remarks
apply
to
predicates
objects
complements
and
modifiers
so
please
when
we
ask
you
to
identify
the
subject
object
etc
in
an
expression
identify
the
entire
phrase
not
just
its
head
word
notice
now
that
as
we
changed
the
subject
of
the
clauses
in
we
also
changed
the
form
of
the
verb
thus
i
goes
with
am
we/you/they
with
are
he/she/it
with
is
when
two
or
more
parts
of
an
expression
are
mutually
dependent
in
this
way
they
are
said
to
agree
with
each
other
that
is
when
one
is
altered
the
other
must
also
be
altered
notice
too
that
in
order
to
create
grammatical
sentences
our
subjects
must
agree
with
their
verbs
if
they
don’t
the
resulting
strings
of
words
are
not
well-formed
standard
english
sentences
a
i
is
at
home
grammatical
in
some
varieties
b
we/you/they
am
at
home
c
he/she/it
are
at
home
the
verb
be
is
the
most
morphologically
complex
verb
in
english
it
has
more
forms
than
other
verbs
see
the
chart
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
and
so
shows
the
agreement
between
subject
and
verb
most
clearly
but
a
reduced
version
of
this
agreement
pattern
can
be
seen
also
in
other
verbs
a
i/you/we/they/bill
and
molly
like
rutabagas
b
he/she/it/fred
likes
rutabagas
most
verbs
have
only
two
forms
in
the
present
tense
one
that
ends
in
s
and
another
that
has
no
ending
the
s
form
occurs
with
third
person
singular
subjects
the
uninflected
form
occurs
with
all
other
subjects
so
in
general
english
subjects
must
agree
with
their
verbs
as
well
as
occur
before
them
we
can
use
these
characteristics
of
subjects
to
determine
just
which
of
several
phrases
in
a
clause
is
its
subject
suppose
for
example
that
we
have
a
sentence
in
the
past
tense
with
several
nps
in
it
and
we
wish
to
decide
just
which
of
these
is
the
subject
now
the
s
marker
does
not
occur
in
the
past
tense
there
are
no
verbs
of
the
form
likeds
in
english
and
except
for
be
the
english
past
tense
shows
no
indication
of
agreement
so
to
observe
the
delahunty
and
garvey
agreement
pattern
we
must
change
the
past
tense
verb
to
the
present
tense
then
we
can
systematically
change
the
nps
in
the
sentence
and
observe
whether
we
must
also
change
the
verb
when
we
find
the
one
and
there
will
be
only
one
np
that
forces
us
to
change
the
verb
in
order
to
create
a
gram
matical
sentence
we
will
have
found
the
subject
of
the
sentence
consider
a
i
liked
your
poem
change
a
to
present
tense
b
i
like
your
poem
remember
that
only
a
third
person
singular
subject
requires
the
s
ending
on
the
verb
note
that
your
poem
is
third
person
if
your
poem
were
the
sub
ject
the
verb
would
be
likes
therefore
your
poem
is
not
the
subject
i
is
not
third
person
singular
but
if
we
change
it
to
she
we
have
to
change
the
verb
to
likes
to
maintain
grammaticality
c
she
likes
your
poem
we
can
conclude
that
she
is
the
subject
of
c
and
because
she
replaced
i
in
b
i
must
be
the
subject
of
b
and
also
of
a
exercise
using
only
subject
verb
agreement
that
is
change
the
nps
and
ob
serve
whether
the
verb
form
must
also
change
identify
the
whole
subject
in
each
of
the
following
sentences
a
he
eats
a
bagel
every
morning
b
she
sees
her
dentist
at
least
twice
a
year
c
gasoline
costs
a
fortune
these
days
d
he
sent
his
mother
flowers
for
mother’s
day
e
chickens
cross
roads
f
there
are
several
cookies
in
the
box
g
it
is
raining
what
problems
did
you
encounter
how
did
you
solve
them
another
way
to
determine
the
subject
of
a
sentence
is
to
replace
all
its
nps
with
pronouns
the
np
that
can
only
be
replaced
by
a
pronoun
in
the
nomi
basic
clause
patternsnative
case
form
will
be
the
subject
thus
a
the
man
handed
the
child
to
the
girl
when
we
replace
each
np
with
an
appropriate
pronoun
we
get
b
he
handed
him
to
her
the
only
nominative
pronoun
is
he
which
replaced
the
man
so
the
man
must
be
the
subject
of
a
exercise
using
only
the
case
of
pronouns
identify
the
whole
subject
of
each
of
the
following
sentences
a
oscar
lies
beautifully
b
oscar
wrote
searingly
witty
plays
c
mary
sent
her
sister
to
the
movies
d
the
books
mary
put
on
the
shelves
e
our
bikes
were
stolen
by
the
over-the-hill
gang
f
it
is
raining
what
problems
did
you
encounter
how
did
you
solve
them
it
is
important
to
have
a
variety
of
ways
of
identifying
subjects
because
it
is
not
always
easy
to
identify
them
in
a
specific
sentence
for
example
more
than
one
np
may
occur
before
the
verb
in
a
sentence
bill
fred
likes
this
is
called
a
topicalized
sentence
the
first
np
bill
is
not
the
subject
as
we
can
see
by
substituting
pronouns
and
observing
their
case
markings
a
him
he
likes
b
he
he
likes
c
he
him
likes
d
him
him
likes
a
is
the
only
grammatical
reformulation
of
and
as
he
is
the
only
nominative
pronoun
it
must
be
the
subject
of
a
and
as
it
is
fred
that
is
delahunty
and
garvey
replaced
by
the
nominative
pronoun
fred
must
be
the
subject
of
fred
is
also
the
subject
by
the
agreement
test
if
we
replace
fred
by
a
first
person
form
we
are
forced
to
change
the
verb
to
like
this
does
not
happen
if
we
change
bill
to
a
first
person
form
a
bill
i
like
b
bill
i
likes
a
me
fred
likes
b
me
fred
like
as
we
noted
elsewhere
the
more
tests
we
have
to
support
an
analysis
the
more
confident
we
can
be
in

semantic

now
that
we
have
developed
ways
to
identify
the
subject
of
a
clause
let’s
examine
another
traditional
definition
of
subject
the
subject
represents
the
doer
of
the
action
this
characterization
sometimes
helps
a

basic
clause
patternshowever
as
a
general
characterization
of
the
subject
it
will
not
do
we
saw
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
that
not
all
verbs
denote
actions
for
example
be
belong
become
seem
ache
know
and
own
denote
states
how
then
can
we
use
the
definition
to
identify
the
subjects
in
a
that
sculpture
belongs
to
the
art
institute
b
egworm
seems
moody
today
c
my
sinuses
ache
d
who
owns
the
earth
the
situation
is
even
more
complex
than
this
because
even
verbs
that
do
denote
actions
may
have
subjects
that
do
not
denote
the
doer
of
that
ac
tion
assuming
that
a
doer
is
a
person
or
at
least
an
animate
entity
that
does
something
a

c
the

d
the

door

silently
in
this
section
we
define
a
set
of
terms
developed
by
linguists
to
describe
the
semantic
roles
of
subjects
as
well
as
of
objects
and
other
phrases
in
clauses
consider
the
sentences
a
john
broke
the
windshield
b
john
approached
mary
john
is
the
subject
of
both
sentences
in
and
in
traditional
grammar
would
have
been
defined
as
the
doer
of
the
actions
of
breaking
the
wind
shield
or
approaching
mary
glossing
the
subject
in
this
way
is
an
attempt
to
provide
a
general
statement
of
the
semantic
relation
between
the
subject
and
the
verb
in
an
indefinite
number
of
sentences
modern
linguists
have
attempted
to
give
a
more
precise
characterization
of
this
relationship
they
would
say
that
john
is
the
agent
of
these
two
sentences
agent
is
defined
as
the
animate
instigator
of
the
action
denoted
by
a
verb
the
term
agent
contrasts
with
other
terms
in
a
set
of
semantic
roles
that
may
be
assigned
to
subjects
and
other
grammatical
relations
compare
the
sentences
of
with
the
sentences
of
a
the
hail
broke
the
windshield
delahunty
and
garvey
b
the
wind
knocked
down
the
power
lines
in
a
the
hail
cannot
be
the
agent
of
the
action
denoted
by
the
verb
this
is
because
hail
is
inanimate
and
so
cannot
be
agentive
by
our
definition
we
will
refer
to
the
inanimate
cause
of
an
event
as
the
force
while
a
force
cannot
be
animate
it
must
have
its
own
potency
to
insist
on
distinguishing
agent
from
force
is
not
to
play
a
mere
terminological
game
lacking
empirical
consequences
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
agent
and
force
in
sentences
and
consider
what
happens
when
we
add
adverbs
of
willfulness
to
the
sentences
a
john
deliberately
broke
the
windshield
b
john
deliberately
approached
mary
a
the
hail
deliberately
broke
the
windshield
b
the
wind
deliberately
knocked
down
the
power
lines
a,b
are
perfectly
innocuous
sentences
requiring
no
special
interpreta
tion
a,b
on
the
other
hand
can
only
be
interpreted
if
we
personify
hail
and
wind
consider
now
john
is
in
the
kitchen
in
john
although
animate
is
in
no
sense
the
doer
or
instigator
of
an
action
and
therefore
is
not
an
agent
we
will
refer
to
the
semantic
relation
ship
that
john
bears
in
as
the
theme
of
the
sentence
theme
is
the
np
referring
to
the
entity
whose
movement
existence
location
or
state
is
predicated
for

the
italicized

john
is
the
theme
as
it
refers
to
the
entity
whose
movement
is
in
question
turkey
is
his
location
the
dardanelles
is
his
path
pakistan
is
his
source
and
malta
is
his

the
path
role
is
played
by
the
np
referring
to
the
route
along
which
the
referent
of
the
theme
moves
for
example
we

the
location
role
is
played
by
the
phrase
that
designates
the
place
or
state
at

in
which
the
referent
of
the
theme
is
at
a
particular
time
for
example
john

a
foul
humor
in
his

role
is
played
by
the
phrase
indicating
the
location
from
which
the
referent
of
the
theme
moves
we
took
the
candy

what
problems
did
you
encounter
how
did
you
solve
them
the
preceding
discussion
should
make
it
clear
how
misleading
it
is
to
define
the
subject
in
terms
of
only
a
single
role
such
as
doer
of
an
action
the
exercise
should
give
you
an
indication
of
how
to
adequately
assign
the
roles
in
specific
instances
as
we
progress
through
the
various
sentence
patterns
we
will
take
the
subject
for
granted
except
for
instances
in
which
its
form
or
semantic
role
helps
us
to
understand
the
pattern
auxiliary
verbs
before
we
deal
with
the
various
basic
clause
patterns
we
must
discuss
a
characteristic
that
all
patterns
have
in
common—their
capacity
to
include
auxiliary
verbs
such
as
be
have
do
and
the
modal
verbs
can
could
may
might
shall
should
will
would
must
as
we
noted
in
other
chapters
these
occur
before
the
main
verb
of
the
clause
a
bill
may/must/might
leave
b
bill
is
leaving
c
bill
has
left
d
bill
left
has
the
modal
verbs
and
do
are
followed
by
a
verb
in
its
infinitival
form
the
progressive
be
is
followed
by
a
verb
ending
in
ing
and
the
perfective
have
is
basic
clause
patternsfollowed
by
a
verb
in
its
past
participle
form
the
passive
be
must
be
mentioned
here
too
unlike
the
progressive
be
it
is
followed
by
a
past
participle
bill
was
followed
by
the
fbi
a
clause
may
contain
several
auxiliary
verbs
bill
may
have
been
being
followed
by
the
fbi
but
they
will
always
occur
in
the
order
modal
perfective
have
progressive
be
passive
be
each
auxiliary
is
enclosed
in
parentheses
because
each
is
optional
and
each
clause
may
contain
from
zero
to
four
auxiliary
verbs
although
the
order
of
auxiliary
verbs
is
invariant
the
position
of
the
first
auxiliary
verb
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
its
clause
depends
upon
the
type
of
clause
involved
in
indicative
clauses
it
occurs
between
the
subject
and
the
verb
phrase
in
interrogatives
the
first
auxiliary
is
placed
to
the
left
of
the
subject
in
negative
clauses
the
negator
not
is
placed
immediately
after
the
first
auxiliary
verb
compare
the
indicative
a
interrogative
b
and
negative
c
clauses
below
a
bill
must
leave
b
must
bill

c

c

delahunty
and
garvey
because
the
placement
of
the
first
auxiliary
verb
is
affected
by
whether
its
clause
is
interrogative
or
indicative
we
place
it
in
a
special
phrase
which
we
call
aux
for
auxiliary
because
every
clause
may
include
auxiliary
verbs
we
include
aux
in
all
the
formal
patterns
that
we
present
below
we
will
deal
in
more
depth
with
the
placement
of
multiple
auxiliaries
in
our
chapter
on
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
tense
and
aspect
what
we
are
calling
basic
clauses
here
are
sentences
consisting
of
a
single
clause
which
we
referred
to
as
simple
sentences
in
our
skeleton
of
english
grammar
chapter
all
english
main
clauses
and
many
types
of
subordinate
clause
must
be
marked
for
tense
and
may
be
marked
for
aspect
we
briefly
introduce
these
two
grammatical
categories
here
and
discuss
tense
more
thoroughly
in
the
appendix
to
this
chapter
t
ense
both
tense
and
aspect
involve
reference
to
time
time
is
a
continuum
on
which
events
succeed
each
other
from
the
past
through
the
present
to
the
future
the
past
is
prologue
and
the
future
is
the
yet-to-be-written
postscript
english
allows
many
ways
to
refer
to
time
in
john
kennedy
was
assassinated
at
p.m
on
november
for
example
the
pps
at
p.m
and
on
november
identify
the
time
of
day
and
the
date
of
kennedy’s
assas
sination
the
time
is
given
in
terms
of
the
two
twelve
hour
periods
into
which
we
divide
days
the
date
is
given
in
terms
of
the
day
of
the
month
and
the
year
in
the
western
calendar
t
ense
is
the
set
of
grammatical
categories
that
languages
use
to
relate
the
time
of
the
situation
denoted
by
the
clause
to
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
said
or
written
grammatical
categories
as
we
have
seen
are
represented
by
elements
of
the
grammar
of
a
language
rather
than
by
its
words
english
gram
matically
distinguishes
three
tenses
past
present
and
future
the
past
and
present
tenses
are
indicated
by
inflectional
morphemes
the
regular
past
tense
is
indicated
by
ed
though
there
are
many
irregular
forms
such
as
was/were
had
did
won
bought
the
regular
present
tense
has
no
marking
unless
the
subject
of
its
clause
is
third
person
singular
in
which
case
the
verb
takes
the
s
inflection
though
again
there
are
a
few
exceptions
such
as
is
has
the
future
is
typically
indicated
by
a
modal
verb
especially
by
will
for
example
a
she
liked
her
linguistics
classes
past
tense
b
she
likes
her
linguistics
classes
present
tense
basic
clause
patterns
c
she
will
like
her
linguistics
classes
future
tense
if
there
is
no
auxiliary
verb
in
a
clause
the
tense
is
marked
on
the
main
verb
as
in
a,b
if
the
clause
does
contain
an
auxiliary
the
tense
will
be
marked
on
the
first
auxiliary
will
in
c
is
in
the
present
tense
its
past
tense
is
would
compare
the
present
and
past
tense
forms
of
the
auxiliaries
in
a
oscar
is/was
playing
bridge
b
oscar
has/had
dealt
the
cards
exercise
to
convince
yourself
that
only
the
first
auxiliary
verb
in
a
sequence
may
be
marked
for
tense
observe
what
happens
when
you
move
the
tense
marking
from
the
first
to
the
other
verbs
in
the
pie
might
have
been
eaten
by
the
cat
e.g
the
pie
may
had
been
eaten
by
the
cat
you
should
find
that
placing
the
tense
marker
on
any
verb
other
than
the
first
one
results
in
ungrammaticality
very
simplistically
the
past
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
represented
by
the
clause
occurred
prior
to
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
uttered
the
present
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
represented
by
the
clause
overlaps
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
uttered
and
the
future
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
is
spoken
about
prior
to
when
it
occurs
if
it
ever
does
for
instance
in
note
the
correlations
between
the
time
adverbs
yesterday
today
and
tomorrow
and
the
verb
forms
in
the
clauses
they
belong
to
yesterday
oscar
inherited
a
million
dollars
today
he
owns
a
testarossa
tomorrow
he
will
be
broke
again
while
these
tense
forms
are
quite
simple
their
actual
uses
are
quite
complex
and
we
deal
with
them
more
fully
in
the
appendix
to
this
chap
ter
exercise
the
following
text
is
from
edith

the

a
identify
all
the
tense
forms
in
the
text
b
delahunty
and
garvey
discuss
the
systematic
difference
between
the
use
of
past
and
present
tense
forms
in
the
passage
why
do
you
think
the
author
used
the
two
tenses
in
this
way
what
would
happen
to
the
text
if
you
were
to
re
write
it
so
that
all
the
present
tense
forms
were
changed
to
past
tense
forms
and
vice
versa
why
would
that
be
so
she
began
to
saunter
about
the
room
examining
the
book
shelves
between
puffs
of
her
cigarette
smoke
some
of
the
volumes
had
the
ripe
tints
of
good
tooling
and
old
morocco
and
her
eyes
lin
gered
on
them
caressingly
not
with
the
appreciation
of
an
expert
but
with
the
pleasure
in
agreeable
tones
and
textures
that
was
one
of
her
inmost
susceptibilities
suddenly
her
expression
changed
from
desul
tory
enjoyment
to
active
conjecture
and
she
turned
to
selden
with
a
question
you
collect
don’t
you—you
know
about
first
editions
and
things
as
much
as
a
man
may
who
has
no
money
to
spend
now
and
then
i
pick
up
something
in
the
rubbish
heap
and
i
go
and
look
at
the
big
sales
she
had
again
addressed
herself
to
the
shelves
but
her
eyes
now
swept
them
inattentively
and
he
saw
that
she
was
preoccupied
with
a
new
idea
and
americana—do
you
collect
americana
selden
stared
and
laughed
no
that’s
rather
out
of
my
line
i’m
not
really
a
collector
you
see
i
simply
like
to
have
good
editions
of
the
books
i
am
fond

she
made
a
slight
grimace

horribly

i
suppose
aspect
aspect
is
the
set
of
grammatical
devices
that
languages
use
to
categorize
situations
according
to
such
characteristics
as
occupying
an
expanse
of
time
taking
only
an
instant
of
time
being
repeated
and
being
complete
al
though
tense
is
probably
much
more
familiar
to
you
than
aspect
aspect
occurs
more
frequently
than
tense
in
the
world’s
languages
english
uses
the
auxiliary
verbs
be
and
have
and
the
idiom
used
to
to
cre
ate
three
grammatical
forms
that
are
regarded
as
aspects
the
progressive
the
perfect
and
the
habitual
respectively
we
distinguish
between
the
a
b
basic
clause
patternsand
c
forms
in

between
a

b
when

c
he

to

the

by

such
as
by
the
habitual
aspect
indicates
that
a
situation
continued
for
such
an
ex
tended
period
of
time
in
the
past
that
it
can
be
taken
as
a
characteristic
of
the
entire
period
we
explore
the
complexities
involved
in
interpreting
these
forms
in
more
detail
below
progressive
aspect
we
begin
by
illustrating
three
features
of
the
interpretation
of
the
progres
sive
aspect
the
form
indicates
that
the
event
is
viewed
as
involving
a
period
rather
than
merely
a
point
of
time
the
jet
changed
direction
the
jet
is
changing
direction
the
first
of
these
two
sentences
is
neutral
with
respect
to
whether
the
change
of
direction
is
sudden
or
gradual
the
second
sentence
characterizes
the
change
of
direction
as
taking
time
how
much
time
is
not
at
issue
the
situation
represented
in
the
progressive
aspect
is
viewed
as
temporary
rather
than
permanent
as
illustrated
in
and
i
live
with
my
parents
i
am
living
with
my
parents
the
progressive
sentence
is
readily
compatible
with
a
continuation
such
as
while
my
own
house
is
being
rebuilt
the
simple
present
is
not
quite
so
natural
with
that
continuation
the
progressive
suggests
that
the
situation
it
represents
is
not
necessarily
complete
as
and
show
the
man
died
the
man
was
dying
the
latter
sentence
is
compatible
with
a
continuation
that
indicates
that
the
dying
process
was
never
completed
but
we
managed
to
save
his
life
the
former
is
not
the
progressive
frequently
represents
a
situation
during
which
another
basic
clause
patternssituation
occurs
the
burglar
was
leaving
by
the
rear
window
when/as
the
police
arrived
it
is
also
interpreted
as
indicating
repeated
action
when
its
main
verb
rep
resents
events
as
taking
only
a
point
of
time
compare
the
following
john
is
hitting
his
carpet
john
is
vacuuming
his
carpet
hit
is
understood
as
taking
only
a
point
of
time
vacuum
as
requiring
a
period
so
a
natural
interpretation
of
the
first
is
that
john
repeatedly
hits
his
carpet
the
second
most
naturally
represents
continuous
activity
not
repeated
vacu
umings
the
final
issue
we
raise
in
regard
to
the
progressive
has
to
do
with
the
classes
of
verbs
that
can
occur
in
this
aspect
we
noted
in
our
chapter
on
ma
jor
parts
of
speech
that
all
verbs
except
those
that
refer
to
states
can
appear
as
progressives
thus
verbs
representing
events
whether
momentary
hit
wink
transitional
arrive
leave
action
drink
type
or
process
grow
widen
occur
with
the
progressive
state
verbs
which
include
verbs
of
perception
hear
see
cognition
know
understand
or
having
and
being
be
contain
own
are
not
compatible
with
the
progressive
there
are
however
certain
state
verbs
that
appear
to
be
exceptions
to
this
generalization
one
can
say
for
example
john
is
being
silly
when
we
view
sentences
such
as
this
from
the
perspective
we
have
developed
we
can
see
that
it
really
is
not
particularly
exceptional
compare
it
to
john
is
silly
the
latter
sentence
suggests
that
silliness
is
a
more
or
less
permanent
or
typical
characteristic
of
john
while
the
former
suggests
merely
that
while
john
is
currently
silly
he
is
not
necessarily
typically
or
permanently
so
if
we
were
to
paraphrase
the
former
sentence
we
would
probably
use
a
verb
such
as
act
john
is
acting
silly
so
it
appears
that
be
in
this
kind
of
sentence
is
interpreted
as
an
activity
rather
than
a
state
verb
we
saw
this
kind
of
recategorization
of
words
earlier
in
our
discussion
of
mass
and
count
nouns
exercise
for
each
of
the
following
sentences
indicate
the
meaning
of
the
progressive
by
selecting
the
appropriate
choice
in

these

the
generalizations

i
got
the
idea
for
my
list
a
couple
of
days
after
christmas
dur
ing
a
memorial
service
for
an
old
friend
who
died
of
huntington’s
disease
as
i
sat
listening
to
stories
about
my
friend
i
thought
about
my
brother
john
who
was
diagnosed
with
oral
cancer
in
and
who
is
now
doing
fine
i
also
thought
about
my
father
who
beat
colon
cancer
years
ago
a
younger
member
of
my
extended
family
basic
clause
patternswho
is
living
with
bipolar
disorder
and
a
friend
facing
the
daily
chal
lenge
of
hepatitis
c
you
see
where
this
is
going
with
my
list
in
hand
i’m
working
toward
a
new
way
of
think
ing
about
health
and
disease
illness
is
the
rule
not
the
exception
that
may
sound
depressing
but
if
i
accept
the
idea—and
how
can
i
not
when
i
read
all
those
names?—then
i
have
to
do
more
than
wait
around
for
the
next
dreaded
phone
call
another
thing
i
can
do
is
be
more
useful
to
the
people
on
my
list
like
most
folks
i
usually
make
it
a
point
not
to
think
about
a
friend’s
or
relative’s
health
problems
when
i’m
hanging
out
with
him
but
talking
can
be
a
good
thing
it
may
not
be
easy—for
either
party—but
there’s
no
doubt
that
sharing
the
burden
of
an
illness
can
be
beneficial
perfect
aspect
the
perfect
aspect
represents
an
earlier
situation
as
being
relevant
in
some
way
at
a
later
time
so
it
must
be
distinguished
from
the
simple
past
tense
situa
tions
that
continue
right
up
to
the
time
of
reference
can
be
viewed
in
this
way
as
can
very
recent
situations
i
have
been
a
taxpayer
since
by
i
had
been
a
taxpayer
for
long
years
in
the
time
of
reference
is
the
time
at
which
the
sentence
is
uttered
so
the
present
perfect
is
used
in
the
time
of
reference
is
which
is
before
now
so
the
past
perfect
is
used
both
sentences
imply
that
the
condition
of
being
a
taxpayer
continued
up
to
the
reference
time
the
situation
need
not
be
a
state
or
condition
when
the
verb
represents
an
event
the
sentence
may
represent
repetition
of
that
event
this
usually
requires
an
appropriate
adverbial
phrase
we
have
visited
norway
every
july
for
years
the
relevance
of
the
situation
represented
by
the
sentence
need
not
be
as
clear
as
the
continuation
of
the
situation
itself
we
have
visited
norway
sug
gests
that
we
made
at
least
one
visit
during
the
period
leading
up
to
the
time
of
utterance
the
situation
may
also
be
interpreted
as
an
event
that
resulted
in
a
state
that
continued
to
the
time
of
reference
the
bus
has
stopped
implies
that
the
bus
is
now
stopped
just
as
mother
has
arrived
implies
that
mother
is
now
here
delahunty
and
garvey
the
relevant
time
span
can
also
be
interpreted
as
shortly
before
the
refer
ence
time
or
recently
i
had
just
finished
another
paper
by
then
have
you
seen
my
spectacles
recently
exercise
using
the
discussion
just
above
identify
what
is
implied
by
the
use
of
the

by

on
the
surprising
speed
at
which
evolution
can
occur
a
identify
all
the
instances
of
the
perfect

in
the
pas
sage
you
should
find
that
almost
all
the
sentences
in
the
passage
are
in
the
perfect
b
what
is
the
tense
of
each
perfect
clause
c
why
do
you
think
the
author
chose
the
perfect
aspect
as
basic
for
this
piece
to
help
with
this
last
question
you
might
try
re-writing
the
passage
without
using
the
perfect
for
example
in
the
simple
past
tense
and
comparing
the
two
versions
we
see
rapid
evolution
most
often
where
some
force
often
us
has
given
it
a
jump

by
suddenly
and
dramatically
altering

either

the

complexity
of
some
of
these

arise
not
from
changes
in

of

but
because
of
choices
in
auxiliaries
and

modifiers
in

have
no
effect
on
the
basic

this
fact
holds
true
even
when

a

is
a

the
modifying
clause
naturally
has
its
own

regardless
of
the
complexity
of
the

nps
in
these
sen
tences
still
represent

a
convenient
test
for
this
pattern
is
to
replace
the

with
appropriate

the
result
will
be
of
the
following
pattern
he/she/it/they
verb
him/her/it/them
nominative
accusative
the
nominative
pronouns
replace
the

np
the
accusative
pronouns
replace
the

by
this
test
sentences
a

e
both
reduce
to
he
delahunty
and
garvey
likes
them
as
in
the
case
of
the
intransitive
pattern
modifiers
and
auxiliaries
do
not
affect
the
basic
pattern
another
test
of
objecthood
is
based
on
the
fact
that
many
clauses
of
pattern
may
be
passivized
generally
direct
objects
may
be
passivized
modifiers
can
never
be

a
multinational

b
poor

are
exploited
by

the
object
of
the
active

corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
passive
you
should
convince
yourself
that
nature
movies
and
poor
countries
really
are
the
subjects
of
b

b
respectively
by
applying
the
tests
for

hood
we
developed
earlier
as
a
final
remark
on
objects
note
that
most
of
the
semantic
roles
available
to
subjects
are
available
also
to
objects
so
objects
may
be
interpreted
in
a
wider
range
of
ways
than
just
the
traditional
entity
affected
by
the
action
of
the

basic
clause
pattern
subject
complement
the
subject
complement
construction
resembles
the
direct
object
pattern
in
basic
clause
patternshaving
three
basic
elements
the
main
difference
between
the
two
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
head
verb
and
the
semantic
relations
it
creates
the
functional
formula
is
a
exemplified
by
b
a
basic
clause
pattern
subject
verb
head
subject
complement
b
mary
became
famous
the
pattern
is
slightly
complicated
by
the
fact
that
two
different
forms
can
act
as
subject
complement
a
noun
phrase
or
an
adjective
phrase
the
italicized
phrases
in
and
illustrate
np
and
ap
complements
re
spectively
a
mary
became
a
doctor
b
you
are
a
nuisance
who
ought
to
be
barred
from
the
pool
c
he
proved
a
success
at
ice-carving
a
mary
became
famous
b
i
am
quite
aware
of
her
foibles
c
he
proved
unwilling
to
cooperate
with
my
attorney
the
formal
formula
for

is
np

which
combines
the
two
formulae
a
b

complements
are
sometimes
called
predicate
nominals
or
predicative
nominatives
ap
complements
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
predicate
ad
jectives
a
pattern
that
is
helpful
in
distinguishing
subject
complements
from
objects
and
modifiers
is
number
agreement
with
the
subject
np
if
we
make
the
subject
np
plural
we
must
also
make
a
subject
complement
np

compare
a

delahunty

garvey
a
mary

terry

b
mary

c
mary

because
english
aps

this
test
does
not
work
for
ap
subject
complements
meaning
can
also
help
identify
a
subject
complement
first
the
subject
and
the
subject
complement
must
denote
the
same
entity
this
may
be
in
dicated
by
assigning
the
subject
and
the
complement
the
same
subscript
maryi
is
a
doctori
thus
mary
and
a
doctor
apply
to
the
same
individual
as
we
noted
above
the
semantic
role
of
the
complement
is
attribute
the
subject
complement
denotes
either
a
permanent
or
a
temporary
status
characteristic
or
property
of
the
subject
understanding
the
function
in
this
way
will
allow
you
to
dis
tinguish
pattern
from
pattern
where
the
np
following
the
verb
group
does
not
ascribe
a
characteristic
to
the
subject
mary
visited
a
doctor
of
course
the
entire
vp
assigns
a
characteristic
of
visiting
a
doctor
to
mary
but
our
test
applies
only
to
the
structure
after
the
verb
in
we
are
referring
to
two
distinct
individuals
in
we
refer
only
to
one
semantics
also
enters
into
the
identification
of
subject
complements
be
cause
of
the
nature
of
the
head
verb
we
can
describe
the
basic
meaning
of
the
verb
in
subject
complement
clauses
as
be/become
these
are
the
primitive
notions
of
state
and
change
of

do
not
confuse
this
dif
ference
with

meanings
of

these

and

the

pattern
just
as

includes
a

object

are
similar
to

in
four
respects
first
an

complement
may
be
formally
expressed
as
either
an
np
or
as
an

b

the
second
feature
common
to
subject

is
that
in
both
an
np
complement
must
agree
with
its
antecedent
the
subject
or
the

i
consider

and
elvis
weirdos/*a

here
again
because
english
aps

be

there
can
be
no
agreement
between
an
ap
object
complement
and
the
direct
object
of
its
clause
basic
clause
patterns
to
see
the
third
parallel
with
subject
complements
we
must
observe
the
semantic
relation
between
the
direct
object
and
its
complement
if
you
consider
carefully
the
sentences
in
and
you
will
notice
that
the
semantic
relations
between
the
object
and
its
complement
are
be
and
become
for
instance
in
c
the
room
becomes
a
ghastly
color
here
again
the
semantic
role
associated
with
the
complement
is
attribute
the
final
similarity
between
subject
and
object
complements
is
that
the
complement
phrase
and
the
subject
or
object
to
which
it
is
semantically
linked
refer
to
the
same
entity
or

we
indicate
this
by
identically

verbs
the
list
in
table
hides
some
complexities
first
most
of
the
verbs
commonly
occur
in
patterns
that
do
not
have
explicit
indirect
objects
a
allison

a
profound

b
walpole

pattern
delahunty
and
garvey
c
finkle
made
a
successful
legislator
pattern
d
we
made
portnoy
our
representative
pattern
second
many
verbs
not
on
the
list
can
be
understood
as
having
a
benefi
ciary
especially
if
they
refer
to
some
type
of
production
wanda
baked
phyllis
a
birthday
cake
third
the
action
denoted
by
the
verb
may
involve
something
that
is
not
literally
transferred
to
a
recipient
nor
is
it
always
beneficial
roscoe
gave
morgentherp
a
sound
thrashing
since
the
meaning
of
verbs
is
so
flexible
it
is
more
illuminating
to
con
sider
the
semantic
roles
assigned
to
the
noun
phrases
in
this
pattern
the
subject
is
likely
to
be
a
causer
such
as
an
agent
or
stimulus
a
anderson
bought
us
souvenirs
agent
b
the
accident
taught
us
a
bitter
lesson
stimulus
indirect
objects
tend
to
be
recipients
or
benefactives
direct
objects
tend
to
be
themes
but
this
is
just
a
tendency
not
an
absolute
restriction
in
for
example
the
subject
is
an
agent
the
direct
object
a
factitive
and
the
indirect
object
is
a
source
they
asked
me
an
unanswerable
question
there
is
a
relatively
reliable
test
for
distinguishing
pattern
from
pattern
constructions
we
will
call
this
the
dative
test
dative
is
the
latinate
term
for
the
case
of
indirect
objects
pattern
clauses
can
generally
though
not
always
be
paraphrased
by
a
clause
pattern
in
which
the
order
of
the
two
object
nps
is
reversed
and
a
preposition
is
inserted
before
the
second
cor
responding
to
the
io
to
usually
indicates
recipient
for
usually
indicates
beneficiary
the
sentences
in
paraphrase
a
selection
of
those
above
a
willard

susie
b
the
eighteenth
century

great
prosperity
to
england
c
she

d

shelves

his

e
wanda
baked
a
birthday
cake
for
phyllis
basic
clause
patterns
f
anderson

for
us
one
drawback
of
the
dative
test
is
that
it
does
not
distinguish
between
the
recipient
and
goal
meanings
of
the
preposition
to
only
the
former
is
relevant
in
this
context
so
a
reflects
pattern
with
a
verb
modifier
not
pattern
a

b
anderson

not
work
with

indirect

construc
tions
a

b
it

a

to/for
me
c
he
gave

a

ambiguous
d
he

a

to
me
unambiguous
the
object
complement
construction
has
no
such
paraphrase
we

president
to/for
him
moreover
we
can
apply
passive
to
the
io
in
pattern
clauses
just
as
we
can
to
the
do
in

i

some

the

the
object
complement

a
final
restriction
on

is
that

basic
clause
patternswhile
the
meanings
and
semantic
roles
represented
by
this
pattern
are
not
identical
to
those
represented
by
pattern
they
are
similar
enough
so
that
many
traditional
and
school
grammars
refer
to
the
np
expressing
the
re
cipient
or
benefactive
roles
as
an
indirect
object
from
a
formal
point
of
view
this
np
is
the
object
of
the
preposition
that
governs
it
so
in
keeping
with
our
formalist
preferences
we
will
restrict
the
term
indirect
object
to
the
np
that
occurs
directly
after
the
verb
and
before
the
direct
object
in
sentences
of
pattern
as
we
noted
in
our
discussion
of
pattern
the
two
patterns
cannot
be
viewed
simply
as
variants
of
each
other
that
is
we
cannot
always
rephrase
a
sentence
in
one
pattern
as
a
sentence
in
the
other
pattern
such
substitutions
may
either
change
the
meaning
or
result
in
ungrammaticality
in
particular
if
the
direct
object
of
a
pattern
sentence
is
a
pronoun
as
in
a
then
rephrasing
the
sentence
as
a
pattern
sentence
results
in
an
ungrammatical
sentence
like
b

these

we
should
briefly
discuss
just
why
we

basic
first
they

all
simple
sentences
that

none
of
them
includes
another

within

second
they

all
be
elaborated
by
the
ad
dition
of
various
types
of
optional
modifiers
such
as
adverbial
phrases
third
and
most
important
is
the
fact
that
each
pattern
is
a
direct
reflection
of
the
class
of
verb
that
heads
the
verb
phrase
in
particular
each
pattern
is
a
reflec
tion
of
the
semantic
roles
assigned
by
the
verb
to
the
phrases
if
any
in
the
predicate
each
pattern
is
also
a
reflection
of
the
formal
requirements
imposed
by
its
head
verb
some
verbs
require
two
nps
some
an
np
and
a

some
nothing

verbs
impose
both
semantic

time
and

we
briefly
discussed

and
aspect
earlier
in
this
chapter
here
we
elabo
delahunty
and
garvey
rate
on
our
discussion
of
english
tenses
while
we
believe
that
every
eng
lish
teacher
should
have
a
good
understanding
of
the
tense
system
we
feel
that
a
more
detailed
knowledge
is
most
essential
for
teachers
responsible
for
the
education
of
students
for
whom
english
is
a
second
or
later
language
however
as
we
ground
our
discussion
of
english
tenses
in
their
character
istic
uses
in
texts
we
believe
that
all
teachers
will
find
information
of
value
in
this
appendix
as
we
noted
every
main
clause
and
many
types
of
subordinate
clause
in
english
are
marked
for
tense
t
ense
is
one
way
of
indicating
when
the
situ
ation
represented
by
the
clause
occurs
in
order
to
sensibly
talk
about
tense
we
must
first
talk
a
little
about
time
and
some
other
ways
in
which
time
is
indicated
in
english
we
conceptualize
time
as
a
line
stretching
indefinitely
far
into
the
past
and
indefinitely
far
into
the
future
the
past
is
behind
us
and
the
future
before
us
note
the
spatial
metaphor
here
the
past
is
time
already
gone
the
future
is
time
yet
to
come
however
times
are
past
present
or
future
in
relation
to
some
chosen
point
of
time
that
point
can
be
either
fixed
or
variable
the
fixed
time
may
be
the
time
of
an
important
cultural
event
for
example
the
birth
of
christ
in
the
western
tradition
or
the
birth
of
mohammed
in
the
muslim
tradition
the
variable
time
is
typically
when
an
utterance
is
spoken
the
time
of
utterance
now
however
in
narratives
and
other
text
types
now
is
determined
within
the
text
identifying
the
time
at
which
situations
occur
relative
to
the
fixed
point
of
time
depends
on
systems
for
measuring
time
we
use
cyclic
occurrences
such
as
days
months
and
years
for
measurement
from
the
fixed
time
point
so
as
we
write
this
the
year
is
the
th
year
following
the
birth
of
christ
the
choice
of
the
beginning
year
is
relatively
arbitrary
but
some
selection
must
be
made
and
going
back
to
the
big
bang
is
a
bit
inconvenient

ways
of
expressing
dates
some

precisely
we
shift
our
focus
now
to
a
discussion
of
a
system
of
time
reference
that
employs
an
implicit
and
constantly
moving
reference
point
imagine
that
you
call
the
garage
where
you
left
your
car
for
repairs
to
ask
if
the
car
is
ready
the
receptionist
who
answers
the
phone
says
the
mechanic
is
working
on
it
right
now
when
does
now
refer
to
we
can
paraphrase
the
reception
ist’s
answer
as
the
mechanic
is
working
on
it
as
i
speak
so
now
refers
to
the
time
at
which
the
utterance
it
occurs
in
is
said
exercise
how
about
then
does
then
simply
refer
to
times
other
than
those
we
would
refer
to
as
now
or
is
it
somewhat
more
complicated
make
up
some
sentences
with
then
and
work
out
the
rules
for
using
it
many
expressions
besides
now
and
then
depend
for
their
full
interpreta
tion
on
identifying
the
time
at
which
they
are
said
they
include
today
yesterday
and
tomorrow
today
refers
to
the
hour
period
beginning
at
midnight
and
extending
to
the
next
midnight
within
which
the
expression
is
said
so
if
on
i
say
i’ll
do
it
today
then
i
am
saying
that
i
will
delahunty
and
garvey
do
it
sometime
during
yesterday
refers
to
the
day
before
the
day
in
which
the
expression
is
said
and
tomorrow
refers
to
the
day
following
the
day
during
which
the
expression
is
said
expressions
that
depend
for
their
full
interpretation
in
this
way
on
when
where
and
by
whom
an
expression
is
uttered
are
called
deictic
expressions

the

are
called

t
enses
it
is
important
to
distinguish
time
from
tense
time
is
a
non-linguistic
phe
nomenon
experienced
by
human
beings
tense
is
a
grammatical
category
one
of
several
ways
that
languages
may
use
to
refer
to
time
english
and
many
though
by
no
means
all
other
languages
have
grammaticized
ways
of
indicating
temporal
characteristics
of
states
of
affairs
that
is
ways
that
have
become
part
of
the
grammar
rather
than
the
vocabulary
of
the
lan
guage
a
tense
is
a
grammaticized
way
to
indicate
when
a
state
of
affairs
occurs
relative
to
the
time
of
utterance
that

the
time
at
which
that

is

about
generally
past

refers
to
a

earlier
than
the
time
of

future
tense
refers
to
a
time
later
then
the
time
of
utterance
and
present
tense
refers
to
a
time
that
is
identical
to
or
more
typically
overlaps
the
time
of

past
tense
we
begin
with
the
english
past
tense
because
we
think
that
its
regular
forms
and
meanings
are
simpler
than
those
associated
with
the
other
tenses
past
tense
forms
the
regular
past
tense
is
formed
by
adding
the
suffix
ed
to
the
word
stem
for
example
delay
delay
ed
print
print

this

is
pronounced

when
the
word
it
is
attached
to
ends
in
a

e.g
lifted
t
when
it
is
attached
to
a
word
that
ends
in
a
voiceless
sound
other
than
t
e.g
kissed
and
d
otherwise
e.g
rowed
the

spelled

tense
meanings
the
basic
meaning
of
the
past
tense
is
very
simple
it
indicates
only
that
something
was
the
case
in
the
past
that
is
before
now
if
i
say
john
was
in
his
room
then
i
am
claiming
that
the
description
john
is
in
his
room
held
in
the
past
it
says
nothing
about
whether
john
is
still
in
his
room
he
may
or
may
not
be
as
can
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
the
sentence
above
can
be
followed
by
either
and
he’s
still
there
or
but
he’s
not
there
now
the
situation
represented
as
occurring
in
the
past
may
involve
a
single
point
of
time
a
repetition
of
events
b
c
a
period
of
time
d
or
a
state
e
respectively
a
the
clock

weekend
d

e

many
years
chris

the
past
tense
is
compatible
with
completed
situations
and
indeed
many
past
tense
sentences
do
denote
situations
that
ended
in
the
past
the
suggestion
that
the
situation
was
completed
in
the
past
is
due
to
a
number
of
factors
but
not
to
the
past
tense
form
itself
for
example
if
the
event
was
instantaneous
as
in
the
balloon
burst
or
if
the
event
has
a
natural
culmination
such
as
i
wrote
a
poem
he
fell
asleep
or
he
read
the
book
the
situations
will
be
interpreted
as
completed
adverbials
can
be
added
to
in
dicate
specific
lengths
of
time
for
three
hours
or
a
particular
period
of
time
yesterday
or
at
a
particular
time
at
midnight
to
indicate
that
an
activity
occurred
regularly
or
repeatedly
in
the
past
we
can
use
adverbials
that
denote
repetition
e.g
i
walked
to
school
every
day
generally
though
not
necessarily
this
will
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
i
no
longer
walk
to
school
if
we
wish
to
indicate
the
period
during
which
these
walks
took
place
we
can
add
an
adverbial
denoting
a
period
of
time
e.g
as
a
child
if
the
situation
continues
through
the
time
of
utterance
we
can
add
an
adverbial
to
that
effect
e.g
as
i
do
to
this
day
in
texts
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
time
to
be
established
early
and
if
that
time
is
in
the
past
then
succeeding
clauses
are
likely
to
be
in
the
past
tense
for
example
in
the
following
text
the
first
sentence
establishes
the
th
century
as
the
time
reference
as
a
result
the
verb
bolded
in
each
succeeding
clause
is
in
the
past
tense
delahunty
and
garvey
the
th
century
has
been
called
the
linguistic
century
during
that
time
scholars
carried
out
a
great
deal
of
research
into
the
dialects
of
sev
eral
european
languages
they
explored
the
historical
relations
among
the
languages
of
europe
and
parts
of
asia
and
developed
concepts
that
are
still
in
use
in
short
th
century
philologists
laid
the
foundations
of
modern
linguistics
a
number
of
researchers
have
argued
that
the
past
tense
indicates
distal
events
by
which
they
mean
situations
or
events
removed
in
one
way
or
another
not
just
in
time
from
the
current
situation
for
example
hypo
thetical
or
conditional
situations
a
if
i
were
a
rich
man
i’d
buy
an
aston
martin
b
if
wishes
were
horses
beggars
would
ride
in
conditionals
the
past
tense
may
be
chosen
instead
of
the
present
to
give
the
impression
that
the
condition
is
unlikely
to
be
fulfilled
compare
a
if
he
has
time
john
will
volunteer
at
the
homeless
shelter
b
if
he
had
time
john
would
volunteer
at
the
homeless
shelter
sentence
a
represents
a
condition
that
is
more
likely
to
be
true
than
the
condition
represented
in
sentence
b
distancing
oneself
from
what
one
is
saying
can
be
used
also
to
indicate
politeness
or
deference
compare
a
i

i
can
borrow
your

i
want
to
ask
you
whether
your

whether

the
bolded
verbs
of
the
a
sentences
are
in
the
present
tense
while
the
bolded
verbs
of
b
are
in
the
past
we
hope
you
will
agree
that
the
b
sentences
are
more
deferential
than
the
a
sentences
we
can
also
put
wishes
and
desires
under
the
heading
of
distal
events
these
are
distal
because
they
are
removed
from
actuality
we
regularly
find
the
past
tense
after
verbs
such
as

i
wish
i

tence
even

establish

of

so
did
people
from

i’ve

the

forms
pronunciation
the
english
simple
present
tense
has
two
forms
one
is
created
by
adding
the
suffix
s
to
the
word
stem
if
the
subject
it
agrees
with
is
third
person
singular
for
example
she
read
s
very
quickly
with
other
subjects
the
form
used
is
the
uninflected
form
for
example
i/you/we/they
read
very
quickly
the
s
suffix
has
three
allomorphs
s
z
and
z
or
z
/@z
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
sibilant
consonant
e.g
passes
s
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
voiceless
non-sibilant
e.g
pats
and
z
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
voiced

meanings
the
simple
present
tense
indicates
that
a
state
of
affairs
holds
at
the
time
of
utterance
the
situation
may
extend
indefinitely
far
into
the
past
and/or
into
the
future
all
the
present
tense
indicates
is
that
the
description
applies
at
the
time
of
utterance
however
this
meaning
interacts
in
interesting
ways
with
the
semantics
of
the
main
verb
and
the
present
tense
is
used
conven
tionally
for
certain
types
of
contexts
and
purposes
even
when

is
not
intended
present
tense
of
state
verbs
the
present
tense
interacts
semantically
with
verb
class
particularly
with
state
and
activity
verbs
we
will
begin
by
illustrating
the
present
tense
with
state
verbs
as
these
are
simpler
for
example
jordan
is
ill
merely
asserts
that
jordan
is
ill
as
the
utterance
is
spoken
he
may
have
been
ill
for
an
indefinite
time
in
the
past
he
may
be
ill
for
an
indefinite
time
in
the
future
or
he
may
have
just
become
ill
and
may
recover
immediately
we
can
demonstrate
that
the
present
tense
is
indifferent
to
the
length
of
time
that
a
situation
lasts
by
showing
that
it
is
compatible
with
contradictory
adverbials
of
time
com
pare
jordan
is
ill
he’s
been
ill
for
years
now
and
it
seems
that
he’ll
be
ill
for
years
to
come
with
jordan
is
ill
he
got
a
sudden
fever
which
will
disappear
as
rapidly
as
it
came
there
are
several
kinds
of
state
verbs
of
which
be
is
the
most
frequent
other
state
verbs
in
the
present
tense
are
interpreted
pretty
much
as
be
is
that
is
as
denoting
a
time
that
extends
through
the
time
of
utterance
and
indefinitely

cognitive
state
verbs
i

because
the
simple

of
state
verbs
denotes
a
state
of
affairs
which
includes
the
present
time
but
may
extend
indefinitely
into
the
past
or
the
future
we
can
indicate
the
extent
of
the
time
involved
by
adding
various
temporal
adverbials
such
as
now
these
days
for
example
she
loves
you
now
but
it
won’t
be
for
long
we
all

we

leaving
shortly
present
tense
of
activity
verbs
with
activity
verbs
the
present
is
interpreted
somewhat
differently
i
exercise
denotes
a
series
of
events
rather
than
a
single
exercise
event
the
series
may
extend
indefinitely
into
the
past
and
the
future
even
though
i
may
not
be
exercising
as
i
utter
the
sentence
the
period
of
time
occupied
by
the
series
includes
the
present
time
so
activity
verbs
in
the
simple
present
can
de
note
repetitions
of
events
that
overlap
the
present
time
this
usage
is
often
referred
to
as
the
iterative
temporal
adverbials
may
be
added
to
indicate
how
regularly
or
frequent
ly
the
events
take
place
everyday
regularly
frequently
when
they
occur
at
noon
whenever
i
feel
like
it
when
they
begin
from
a.m
when
they
end

and
how
long
they
last

an
hour
while
watching
the
young

the
restless
for
example
i
exercise
everyday
for
an
hour
from

a.m
many
textbooks
claim
that
the
present
tense
of
activity
verbs
denotes
ha
bitual
or
regular
actions
however
their
examples
typically
include
adverbi
als
indicating
regularity
or
habituality
the
present
tense
itself
says
nothing
about
frequency
or
regularity
the

can
say
without

such

we
know
new

has

along

that

on

they
themselves
are
doing
for
example
when
a
speaker
is

some

say

recipe
they
may
use
the
simple

for
historical

to

the
present
tense
is
often
used
to
refer
to
past
events
in
narratives
and
stories
a
use
that
is
often
referred
to
as
the
historical
present
for
example
so
the
cop
comes
over
to
us
and
says
scheduled
events
in
the
future
the
simple
present
may
also
be
used
to
denote
future
scheduled
or
planned
events
tom

dallas
tomorrow
adverbials

when
the
event
is
to
take

may
be
included
in
the
example
above
no
repetition
of
basic
clause
patternsevents
is
denoted
but
other
examples
may
be
interpretable
as
denoting
ei
ther
a
single
future
scheduled
event
or
a
series
of
events
flight

p.m
unless
a
unique
time
is
understood
from
the
context
or
specified
in
the
sentence
flight
leaves

p.m
tomorrow
this
usage
is
not
possible
with
events
that
are
not
schedulable
for
ex
ample
it
freezes
tonight
is
strange
because
even
if
the
freeze
were
accurately
and
confidently
forecast
it
is
still
not
scheduled
however
even
though
scheduling
is
typically
done
by
humans
nature
may
be
regular
enough
so
that
certain
events
may
be
regarded
as
scheduled
we
can
say
el
niño
re
turns
next
year
during
the
year
prior
to
when
we
know
that
phenomenon
regularly
returns
however
comrie
fn
points
out
sentences
like
the
train
departs
at
five
o’clock
tomorrow
morning
is
not
synonymous
with
sentences
like
the
train
is
scheduled
to
depart
at
five
o’clock
tomorrow
morning
the
first
does
say
explicitly
that
the
train
will
depart
at
the
said
hour
and
more
over
that
this
is
the
result
of
scheduling
the
latter
however
says
only
that
according
to
the
schedule
five
o’clock
is
the
train’s
departure
time
but
does
not
say
that
the
train
will
in
fact
leave
according
to
that
schedule
so
there
is
no
contradiction
in
saying
the
train
is
scheduled
to
leave
at
five
o’clock
to
morrow
morning
but
in
fact
it
won’t
leave
till
six
but
it
is
contradictory
to
say
the
train
departs
at
five
o’clock
tomorrow
morning

in

it

leave

performatives

i

which
both
admits

names
the
admit

always
occur
in
the
simple

because
their
effect
coincides
with

often

such
adverbs
as

are
always

but
always
the
same

is
part
of
its
being
monday
a
process
which
started
last
thing
on
sunday
night
with
remember
ing
to
put
out
the
rubbish—which
is
more
complicated
than
it
once
was
since
the
council
now
recycles
rubbish
and
there
are
different
coloured
plastic
bags
and
different
weekly
schedules
for
paper
and
plastics
and
bottles
cardboard
however
you
still
have
to
either
put
in
with
the
normal
rubbish
or
take
it
up
to
the
council
dump
by
the
dog
track
which
mr
and
mrs
phillips
have
formally
decided
after
doing
it
what
felt
like
a
million
times
they
can
no
longer
be
bothered
to
do
the
future
the
grammar
of
the
future
is
more
complex
than
that
of
the
past
or
present
tenses
there
are
several
grammatical
forms
each
with
different
interpreta
tions
in
english
these
forms
are
not
inflectional
the
most
important
one
the
will
future
is
created
with
a
modal
verb
the
fact
that
the
main
english
future
is
modal
has
led
some
linguists
to
claim
that
english
has
no
future
tense
this
is
certainly
true
if
by
tense
we
mean
inflected
verb
forms
denot
ing
future
situations
however
english
has
several
grammatical
means
of
indicating
futurity
as
you
might
expect
but
probably
didn’t
think
to
put
it
quite
so
oddly
the
future
is
what
now
is
prior
to
mccawley
and
the
gram
matical
future
forms
locate
situations
in
time
subsequent
to
the
present
moment
comrie
however
the
future
is
conceptually
different
from
the
present
and
the
past
arguably
there
is
only
one
actual
past
and
one
actual
present
but
there
are
many
futures
there
is
the
future
that
we
have
planned
the
fu
ture
we
predict
the
future
we
wish
for
the
future
that
we
have
to
bring
about
and
lots
of
others
and
of
course
there
is
the
future
that
will
actu
ally
occur
although
as
mccawley
remarks
t]he
notion
of
‘actual
future’
may
give
one
a
queasy
feeling
in
view
of
the
fact
that
one
has
very
little
conception
of
which
of
the
infinitely
many
possible
futures
is
the
actual
one
nonetheless
speakers
of
natural
languages
frequently
indulge
delahunty
and
garvey
in
the
rashness
of
making
statements
that
purport
to
describe
the
actual
future
mccawley
so
there
are
lots
of
possible
futures
which
is
why
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
for
a
language
to
use
its
modal
system
as
its
main
grammatical
way
of
denoting
futurity
in
this
section
we
describe
the
various
grammatical
forms
used
to
denote
future
in
english
and
the
particular
kinds
of
futures
each
denotes
will
forms
the
form
often
called
the
simple
future
is
created
by
using
the
modal
verb
will
followed
by
an
uninflected
verb
form
jake
will
bring
it
sometimes
especially
in
formal
contexts
and
in
british
english
shall
may
be
used
in
stead
of
will
when
the
subject
of
the
sentence
is
first
person
i
or
we
i
shall
return
we
shall
overcome
meanings
the
will
future
simply
indicates
that
a
situation
will
obtain
in
the
future
relative
to
the
time
of
utterance
when
the
situation
begins
and
how
long
it
lasts
are
irrelevant
to
the
will
future
it
is
compatible
with
situations
that
began
in
the
past
held
through
the
present
and
will
continue
indefinitely
into
the
future
deborah
still
loves
raymond
and
will
love
him
forever
in
this
example
still
indicates
that
the
state
of
affairs
deborah
loves
raymond
held
in
the
past
and
has
held
up
to
now
forever
obviously
indicates
that
the
situation
will
continue
indefinitely
the
will
future
is
also
consistent
with
situations
that
begin
and
end
within
a
very
short
time
in
the
future
the
clock
will
chime
once
at
exactly
midnight
tonight
when
a
state
of
affairs
begins
and
ends
can
be
indicated
by
various
temporal
adverbials
how
long
a
state
of
affairs
lasts
may
also
be
indicated
by
the
nature
of
the
main
verb
specifically
by
whether
or
not
it
is
punctual
as
well
as
by
various
adverbials
the
balloon
will
pop
presently
timothy
will
remain
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
pop
denotes
an
event
that
takes
no
more
than
a
moment
of
time
remain
denotes
a
state
that
occupies
an
indefinite
period
of
time
the
will
future
is
compatible
also
with
events
that
occur
at
specific
times
in
the
future
i’ll
give
you
your
money
at
noon
tomorrow
it
is
also
compatible
with
vague
times
the
earth
will
certainly
be
hit
by
a
large
meteor
but
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
just
when
that
will
happen
like
the
present
and
the
past
the
future
interacts
with
the
type
of
main
verb
involved
with
state
verbs
the
will
future
indicates
an
unchanging
basic
clause
patternsstate
of
affairs
that
will
hold
in
the
future
context
or
adverbials
may
indicate
when
it
began
or
when
it
will
end
he

verbs
the
future
can
denote
either
single
or
repeated
oc
currences
of
events
just
which
is
determined
by
other
parts
of
the
sentence
such
as
an
object
or
a
temporal
adverbial

an

this

with

followed
by
the
uninflected

a
verb
jake
is

if
the
be
is
the
first
auxiliary
verb
in

clause
it
must
be
inflected
to
indicate
the
person
and
number
of
its
subject
as
well
as
the
tense
of
the
clause
it
may
be
inflected
for
present
or
past
tense
with
the
past
tense
we
create
a
future
of
a
past
john
was
going
to
leave
but
he
missed
his
plane
stylistically
be
going
to
is
less
formal
than
will
and
is
more
frequent
in
conversational
than
in
written
english
it
is
often
pronounced
g
n
delahunty
and
garvey
which
is
typically
spelled
gonna
meanings
be
going
to
communicates
a
more
certain
future
than
will
either
because
the
speaker
strongly
intends
to
bring
that
future
about
or
it
has
already
been
planned
i
am
going
to
finish
this
if
it
kills
me
it’s
all
arranged
i
am
going
to
fly
to
los
angeles
next
week
the
future
may
also
be
quite
certain
because
it
results
from
causes
op
erating
in
the
present
the
temperature
is
dropping
it’s
going
to
snow
he’s
points
ahead
he’s
going
to
win
the
game
when
used
to
express
the
future
result
of
a
current
cause
be
going
to
communicates
an
inference
that
the
result
will
occur
almost
immediately
this
suggestion
of
immediacy
appears
to
be
due
to
pragmatic
factors
if
the
result
is
not
going
to
be
immediate
then
the
speaker
may
override
the
infer
ence
with
a
temporal
adverbial
such
as
next
month
next
year
in
for
example
current
weather
trends
indicate
that
we
are
going
to
have
very
cold
weather
next
week/month/year
in
spite
of
their
differences
will
and
be
going
to
are
often
interchangeable
without
much
apparent
effect
for
example
they
will
be
in
the
hospital
for
ten
days/they
are
going
to
be
in
the
hospital
for
ten
days
i
think
it’ll
rain/i
think
it’s
going
to
rain
in
other
cases
substituting
be
going
to
for
will
causes
significant
changes
of
meaning
for
example
expressing
an
intention
with
will
allows
it
to
be
interpreted
as
an
offer
i’ll
bring
dessert
whereas
expressing
that
intention
with
be
going
to
suggests
a
fixed
plan
i’m
going
to
bring
dessert
it
may
also
suggest
the
speaker’s
expectation
that
someone
might
try
to
thwart
their
intention
compare
i’ll
answer
it
with
i’m
going
to
answer
it
when
the
phone
rings
similarly
substituting
be
going
to
for
will
in
requests
and
promises
causes
them
to
seem
either
preemptory
and
intrusive
or
questions
about
statements
of
fact
are
you
going
to
bring
the
beer
this
time
i
am
going
to
help
you
on
saturday
whether
you
like
it
or
not
in
some
contexts
substituting
will
for
be
going
to
results
in
ungrammati
cality
compare
if
it’s
going
to
rain
you

introduction
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
we
dealt
with
simple
sentences
that
is
sentences
that
contain
only
one
clause
consisting
of
an
np
subject
aux
and
vp
predicate
in
this
chapter
we
examine
sentences
in
which
elements
of
simple
sentences
are
moved
from
their
canonical
positions
are
understood
even
though
no
words
are
present
and
in
which
certain
kinds
of
elements
are
inserted
into
clauses
to
fulfill
certain
functions
in
order
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
movement
deletion
and
insertion
we
will
introduce
elements
from
a
theory
of
syntax
called
transformational
gram
mar
specifically
we
will
distinguish
between
a
clause’s
deep
structure
ds
the
nature
of
which
we
will
make
clear
later
and
its
surface
structure
ss
i.e
the
form
it
actually
occurs
in
we
will
also
introduce
transformational
rules
i.e
the
rules
that
move
delete
and
insert
linguistic
elements
in
the
journey
from
deep
to
surface
structure
as
we
go
along
we
will
also
dis
cuss
the
discourse
functions
of
the
sentence
types
we
introduce
to
fol
low
the
development
of
one
strand
of
transformational

a

movement
we
begin
by
examining
sentence
variations
that
involve
the
movement
of
elements
from
one
position
to
another
in
a
clause
we
begin
with
one
of
the
simplest
of
these
variations
particle
movement
particle
movement
particles
are
words
such
as
up
or
over
that
may
occur
as
prepositions
when
they
take
their
own
np
objects
or
as
adverbs
when
they
modify
vs
or
vps
when
these
words
combine
with
a
verb
to
create
an
idiomatic
unit
they
are
called
particles
for
example
combining
look
and
up
creates
the
phrasal
verb
look
delahunty
and
garvey
up
in
the
following
sentences
a
bill
looked
up
the
number
b
bill
looked
the
number
up
these
two
sentences
differ
only
in
the
position
of
the
particle
up
in
the
first
it
occurs
between
the
verb
and
the
object
in
the
second
to
the
right
of
the
object
both
sentences
contain
the
same
words
and
the
phrases
par
ticularly
the
nps
perform
the
same
grammatical
functions
in
both
bill
is
the
subject
the
number
is
the
direct
object
moreover
the
two
sentences
are
synonymous
by
this
we
mean
specifically
that
the
semantic
roles
see
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
assigned
to
the
nps
are
the
same
in
both
sentences
bill
is
the
agent
and
the
number
is
the
theme
as
native
speak
ers
we
can
assert
these
facts
with
certainty
and
expect
universal
agreement
among
english
speakers
because
knowledge
of
the
relationships
between
sentence
pairs
like
these
is
part
of
every
native
english
speaker’s
competence
it
must
be
expressed
in
a
grammar
at
issue
is
how
to
do
this
we
can
assign
the
following
analyses

sentences

can’t
we
declare

leave

and
go
on
to
the
next
topic
the
answer
is
that
while
the
two
rules
b
c
might
be
just
coincidentally
similar
speakers
of
english
know
that
the
sentences
they
represent
are
related
that
they
are
variant
forms
of
each
other
if
we
assume
that
a
goal
of
our
grammar
is
to
represent
native
speakers’
linguistic
knowledge—their
linguistic
competence
then
we
have
to
represent
the
relationship
between
pairs
of
sentence
like
a,b
we
will
adopt
a
strategy
similar
to
the
one
we
adopted
in
phonology
and
morphology
namely
that
variant
forms
e.g
allophones
and
allomorphs
are
assumed
to
be
differ
ent
representations
or
manifestations
of
the
same
abstract
form
so
a,b
are
different
surface
manifestations
of
an
abstract
structure
that
they
have
in
common
much
as
the
allomorphs
s
z
and
z
are
manifestations
of
the
morpheme
s
this
common
abstract
form
is
the
deep
structure
the
actual
strings
of
words
and
their
structural
organizations
are
the
surface
structures
the
deep
structure
and
surface
structure
of
a
sentence
are
connected
by
transforma
tional
rules
or
just
transformations
which
move
delete
or
insert
items
we
will
make
a
few
assumptions
about
deep
structures
first
they
are
created
by
phrase
structure
rules
psrs
like
those
in
second
elements
that
are
semantically
closely
related
must
be
syntactically
closely
related
in
ds
so
for
example
in
particle
sentences
such
as
a,b
because
the
par
ticle
and
verb
are
closely
associated
semantically
they
must
be
closely
associ
ated
in
ds
consequently
we
should
prefer
look
up
the
number
rather
than
look
the
number
up
as
the
ds
arrangement
of
words
third
as
we
will
discuss
in
greater
depth
later
if
a
verb
assigns
a
semantic
role
to
an
np
then
that
np
must
be
in
the
same
clause
as
the
verb
we
have
now
argued
that
a
represents
the
ds
of
both
a
b
the
sur
face
structure
of
a
is
identical
in
all
relevant
respects
to
its
deep
structure
the
surface
structure
of
b
is
slightly
different
from
its
deep
structure
specifically
regarding
the
position
of
the
particle
we
account
for
this
slight
difference
by
hypothesizing
a
transformation
called
particle
movement
pm
which
moves
a
particle
from
its
deep
structure
position
beside
its
verb
places
it
to
the
right
of
the
direct
object
and
attaches
it
to
the
vp
this
delahunty
and
garvey
yields
the
surface
structure
b
the
transformational
approach
has
the
advantage
of
expressing
by
the
common
deep
structure
native
speakers’
knowledge
that
pairs
of
sentenc
es
like
a,b
are
grammatically
related
the
grammar
represents
the
two
sentences
as
transformational
variants
of
each
other
analogous
to
the
ways
in
which
allophones
and
allomorphs
are
related
to
each
other
as
variants
of
underlying
abstract
phonemes
or
morphemes
assigning
sentences
a
com
mon
deep
structure
also
expresses
the
fact
that
the
sentences
are
broadly
synonymous
with
each
other
specifically
in
that
a
given
noun
phrase
will
have
the
same
semantic

particle
movement
has
no
effect
on

of
sentences
to
which
it
has
applied
the
semantic
roles
of
the
nps

the

affected

are
exactly
the

as
those
in

unaffected
are
both
sentence

freely
interchangeable
in

then
the
answer
to
this
should
be
clear
from
the
exercise
above
pm
is
gen
erally
optional
but
it
must
apply
if
the
object
is
a
pronoun
it
seems
plau
sible
to
assume
that
at
least
one
factor
in
determining
where
to
place
the
particle
is
the
informational
status
of
the
object
np
if
the
np
represents
old
known
or
given
information
and
pronouns
are
typically
in
this
cat
egory
then
the
particle
moves
to
the
right
if
the
np
represents
new
information
the
particle
is
placed
between
v
and
np
this
is
an
example
of
the
interaction
between
the
syntactic
and
pragmatic
components
of
the
grammar
another
factor
and
probably
the
more
important
one
is
the
length
of
the
object
np
the
longer
the
np
the
more
likely
the
particle
is
to
appear
before
rather
than
after
it
as
the
following
sentences
show
a
he
looked
it
up
b
he
looked
the
number
up
c
he
looked
his
boss’s
number
up
d
he
looked
the
number
that
he
had
written
on

can
have

because

also
because

sition

many
but
by

all

make

that

in

in
the
interests
of

we
will
adopt
that
assumption
in
this
section
we
will
assume
also
that
with
very
few
exceptions
such
as
expletive
it
and
there
every
np
in
a
sentence
must
be
assigned
one
but
no
more
than
one
semantic
role
consider
now
the
sentences
a
bill
carried
mary
b
mary
bill
carried
in
both
of
these
sentences
bill
is
the
agent
and
mary
is
the
theme
note
however
that
mary
occurs
in
two
different
positions
in
these
sentences
in
a
it
occurs
in
the
direct
object
position
in
b
it
is
in
what
is
known
as
the
topic
position
speakers
of
english
know
that
both
of
these
sentences
denote
that
bill
carried
mary
let’s
assume
that
we
have
a
rule
whereby
carry
assigns
theme
to
its
direct
object
in
sentences
like
a
must
we
now
as
sume
that
we
need
another
rule
to
account
for
the
assignment
of
theme
to
mary
in
the
topic
position
let’s
examine
that
possibility
such
a
rule
might
say
assign
theme
to
the
np
directly
to
the
left
of
the
subject
of
the
clause
in
which
the
assigning
verb
occurs
however
when
we
examine
some
more
data
we
can
see
that
this
becomes
impossible

insert
and
further
expressions
of
the
form
np
vs
that
in
the
posi
tion
occupied
by
the
ellipses
in
c
in
each
of
the
sentences
of
mary
is
understood
as
the
theme
of
car
ried
but
we
can
insert
as
many
that-clauses
between
mary
and
carried
as
we
wish
there
is
no
principled
bound
to
the
number
of
such
clauses
it
follows
that
for
an
infinite
number
of
sentences
we
would
need
an
infinite
number
of
rules
to
assign
theme
to
mary
clearly
such
a
set
of
rules
could
not
exist
in
anyone’s
mind
we
must
therefore
find
an
alternative
way
of
assigning
a
semantic
role
to
all
these
different
but
related
positions
rather
than
devise
a
complex
set
of
rules
that
would
directly
assign
theme
to
mary
in
all
these
positions
linguists
have
simplified
the
assign
ment
process
by
assuming
something
like
the
following
a
verb
such
as
carry
assigns
theme
to
its
deep
structure
direct
object
this
phrase
may
afterwards
be
moved
by
transformations
though
it
will
always
be
associated
with
its
original
deep
structure
position
and
therefore
with
its
semantic
role
in
support
of
this
idea
note
that
we
cannot
put
another
np
into
the
object
position
and
still
interpret
the
resulting
s
as
mary

mary
bill

susie
we
can
only
interpret
mary
in
as
an
addressee
and
not
as
a
direct
object
susie
has
taken
over
that
role
because
mary
can
no
longer
be
associated
with
the
do
position
it
cannot
be
interpreted
as
theme
so
the
deep
struc
ture
position
with
which
a
moved
phrase
is
associated
and
from
which
it
derives
its
semantic
role
must
be
empty
let’s
now
think
about
the
position
that
the
topicalized
phrase
occupies
in
surface
structure
there
are
various
possibilities
one
is
that
topicalization
inserts
the
topicalized
phrase
directly
under
s
however
we
will
introduce
a
new

for

which
requires
a

rule
to

delahunty

comp
s
we
will

that

a
position
outside
of

that

in

it
is
never
as
signed
a
semantic
role
directly
a
phrase
in
comp
acquires
its
semantic
role
by
virtue
of
its
association
with
some
deep
structure
position
this
associa
tion
is
represented
by
the
transformation
that
moves
the
phrase
as
every
np
must
be
assigned
a
semantic
role
it
follows
that
there
can
be
no
np
in
comp
in
deep
structure
we
will
call
positions
that
cannot
be
assigned
a
semantic
role
directly
in
ds
non-argument
positions
this
is
often
ab
breviated
as
a
read
a-bar
in
the
literature
argument
a
positions
are
those
positions
within
s
to
which
semantic
roles
may
be
assigned
in
deep
structure
they
include
as
you
no
doubt
guessed
subjects
objects
and
ob
jects
of
prepositions
we
will
discover
later
that
while
these
positions
may
be
assigned
a
semantic
role
they
occasionally
are
not
so
topicalization
moves
a
phrase
from
an
a
position
to
which
a
semantic
role
has
been
assigned
to
an
a

the
changes
that
the
topicalization
transformation
makes
to
the
ds
as
it
changes
it
into
the
ss
discourse
functions
of
topicalization
every
native
speaker
of
english
knows
that
topicalized
and
non-topicalized
sentences
express
essentially
the
same
message
the
semantic
roles
of
the
various
nps
in
the
sentences
are
unchanged
by
the
movement
there
is
nonetheless
a
difference
between
the
two
forms
the
non-topicalized
is
a
more
general-purpose
construction
than
the
topicalized
which
we
would
use
only
in
special
contexts
the
most
typical
reaction
speakers
of
english
have
upon
hearing
sen
tences
such
as
the
forks
you
put
on
the
left
is
that
the
entity
or
entities
referred
to
by
the
topic
np
the
forks
have
al
ready
been
introduced
directly
or
indirectly
into
the
discourse
so
might
occur
as
the
answer
to
which
side
do
i
put
the
forks
on
a
second
and
closely
related
use
of
topicalized
sentences
is
to
refer
to
an
entity
that
is
a
member
of
a
set
of
related
entities
that
has
already
been
introduced
into
the
discourse
a
typical
other
sentence
to
go
along
with
might
be
and
the
knives
you
put
on
the
right
knives
and
forks
are
members
of
the
set
of
silverware
items
and
if
you
came
upon
a
conversation
in
which
was
the
first
sentence
you
heard
delahunty
and
garvey
you
could
reasonably
assume
that
the
speakers
had
already
mentioned
silverware
and
one
speaker
was
now
listing
the
individual
members
of
the
silverware
set
and
telling
a
child
for
example
where
each
one
goes
in
a
place
setting
so
the
np
in
topic
position
can
refer
to
a
member
of
a
set
of
items
that
has
already
been
introduced
into
the
discourse
just
to
show
you
that
we’re
not
simply
making
this
up
out

the

authentic

sixty

here
the
topic
is
a
student’s
grade
thirty
and
sixty
one
percent
are
mem
bers
of
the
set
of
possible
grades
sixty
one
can
be
topicalized
because
it
is
a
member
of
the
already
mentioned
set
and
contrasts
with
thirty
to
sum
up
our
discussion
of
topicalization
topicalization
moves
any
phrase
from
its
position
within

the

the

retains
the

it

must
agree
in
person
number
and

with
the

of
its

that
is
the
form
of
the
reflexive

is
dependent
upon
the
grammatical
characteristics
of
the

clearly
for
this

be
the

there
must

this
in
mind
consider
a

yourself/yourselves
delahunty

we
can
explain
this
pattern
of
data
by
assuming
that
the
deep
structure
of
a,b
is
c
you
shave
yourself
because
the
only
reflexive
that
can
occur
here
is
the

singular

can

if
we
assume
that
the
aux
phrase
can
be
occupied
by
either
a
modal
or
a
marker
that
indicates
that
the

is
an

then

deletion
under

a
typical
case
in
which
the
prior

allows

ery

deletion
is
more
complex
than
we
have
represented
it
when
we
exam
ine
it
more
closely
we
discover
some
interesting
things
about
the
structure
of
the

as
the
following

show
a

in
general
transformations
operate
on
phrases
rather
than
arbitrary
strings
of
words
and
if
we
assume
that
this
must
be
the
case
then
each
of
the
sequences
v
np
been
v
np
and
have
been
v
np
must
be
a
phrase
it
follows
that
vp
is
composed
of
several
levels
of
phrase
structure
and
that
vp
deletion
may
apply
to
any
of
these
levels
v

some
discourse
functions
of
deletion
the
fundamental
function
of
deletion
is
to
make
processing
discourse
easier
for
both
its
producers
and
its
audiences
the
producer
has
to
say
or
write
less
the
audience
has
less
to
hear
and
process
our
minds
derive
inferences
jump
to
conclusions
more
rapidly
than
they
process
linguistic
input
so
deletion
takes
advantage
of
that
difference
in
processing
speed
by
reducing
linguistic
input
and
allowing
the
mind
to
fill
in
the
blanks
and
sometimes
delahunty
and
garvey
too
to
say
less
is
to
say
more
insertion
there
are
clause
types
which
under
certain
circumstances
require
the
inser
tion
of
apparently
superfluous
expressions
we
briefly
discuss
clauses
whose
subject
is
non-referential
there
existential
there
sentences
english
contains
pairs
of
sentences
such
as
the
following
which
like
active
and
passive
pairs
are
essentially
synonymous
but
with
some
subtle
differ
ences
a
a
unicorn
is
in
the
garden
b
there
is
a
unicorn
in
the
garden
the
second
differs
from
the
first
in
that
its
subject
contains
existential
there
which
does
not
refer
to
a
specific
location
and
the
phrase
that
corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
first
sentence
a
unicorn
occurs
after
the
verb
be
how
are
we
to
represent
the
similarities
and
differences
between
such
sentences
as
you
have
probably
guessed
at
this
point
a
modern
linguist
is
likely
to
say
that
they
are
transformationally
related
that
is
they
both
have
deep
structures
similar
to
a
but
the
derivation
of
b
involves
a
transfor
mation
that
moves
the
subject
phrase
into
the
vp
and
another
that
inserts
there
into
the
vacated
subject
slot
what
gives
us
the
right
to
say
that
the
np
that
follows
the
verb
is
the
subject
in
existential
there
sentences
when
subjects
generally
occur
before
their
verbs
in
english
clauses
normally
english
verbs
agree
with
their
surface
structure
subjects
in
existential
there
sentences
however
the
verb
agrees
with
the
np
that
follows
it
in
surface
structure
a
there
are
unicorns
in

b
there

in

b

although
its

is
acceptable
in
informal

c
the

delahunty
and

d
the
pretzels
were

as
a
general
rule
passive
sentences
have
active
counterparts
although
a
missing
agent
phrase
may
have
to
be
expressed
as
an
indefinite
pronoun
a
the
baby-sitter
fed
the
children
b
the
mice
ate
the
pretzels
c
someone
fed
the
children
d
someone/something

the

a
note
on
the
use
of
passive
sentences
style
manuals
and
many
school
grammars
and
composition
textbooks
ad
vise
students
and
writers
generally
to
avoid
the
passive
however
research
has
demonstrated
that
student
writers
use
the
passive
less
often
than
expert
writers
garvey
and
lindstrom
it
would
appear
therefore
that
what
students
need
to
learn
is
how
to
use
the
passive
appropriately
a
piece
of
advice
that
applies
to
all
sentence
types
there
are
two
major
traditional
objections
to
passives
first
they
are
alleged
to
be
deceitful
they
can
and
often
do
omit
reference
to
the
agent
responsible
for
an
event
second
because
they
begin
with
an
np
whose
se
mantic
role
is
not
an
agent
and
include
a
form
of
be
they
are
alleged
to
be
weak
in
response
to
the
first
objection
we
say
that
omitting
pieces
of
sentences
is
not
something
that
only
passives
can
do
many
if
not
all
sentence
types
can
so
in
this
regard
writers
need
to
decide
just
what
information
must
be
presented
and
what
can
be
omitted
from
a
text
this
is
a
matter
of
audience
not
just
of
grammar
in
response
to
the
second
objection
most
languages
of
the
world
have
constructions
that
correspond
to
the
english
passive
it
would
be
most
un
likely
for
these
constructions
to
have
developed
and
been
retained
if
they
were
not
of
considerable
value
what
they
do
is
allow
the
information
rep
delahunty
and
garvey
resented
in
the
active
to
be
restructured
because
old
familiar
or
given
in
formation
tends
to
be
placed
before
new
information
so
that
it
can
be
easily
connected
with
its
prior
context
passive
allows
old
information
that
would
be
placed
later
in
the
corresponding
active
to
be
appropriately
placed
earlier
additionally
truncation
deletion
of
the
agentive
phrase
from
a
passive
allows
speakers
and
writers
to
efficiently
avoid
repeating
information
that
may
be
readily
derivable
from
the
context
omission
of
the
agentive
phrase
also
allows
scholars
a
polite
way
to
criticize
each
other
meyers
in
fact
all
languages
provide
means
to
allow
information
to
be
restruc
tured
in
english
alone
we
have
at

the
following

the
order
in
which
information
is
deployed
in
a
sentence
depends
upon
a
number
of
factors
including
whether
it
is
already
familiar
to
the
audience
whether
it
is
topical
and
whether
the
speaker/writer
wishes
to
give
it
special
prominence
each
of
the
constructions
illustrated
just
above
has
its
own
idio
syncratic
textual
effects
and
so
must
be
used
in
appropriate
contexts

introduction
the
discussion
in
this
chapter
depends
on
a
distinction
between
sentences
and
clauses
clauses
as
we
noted
are
grammatical
units
comprising
one
subject
and
one
predicate
and
consequently
one
main
verb
sentences
are
grammatical
units
comprising
one
or
more
clauses
an
understanding
of
the
ways
in
which
clauses
combine
to
form
sentences
is
valuable
to
teach
ers
helping
students
develop
more
sophisticated
writing
skills
multi
clause
sentences
allow
the
integration
of
several
propositions
into
a
single
gram
matical
unit
one
hallmark
of
good
style
is
an
appropriate
sequencing
of
simple
and
complex
sentences
the
ability
to
compose
appropriately
com
plex
sentences
can
be
fostered
by
clause-combining
exercises
multi
clause
sentences
the
clauses
that
constitute
multi
clause
sentences
can
be
combined
either
by
coordination
subordination
or
both
called
complex
compound
and
compound-complex
sentences
respectively
the
most
inclusive
clause
in
each
sentence
is
its
main
clause
in
light
italics
in
the
examples
just
below
which
must
be
marked
as
either
present
or
past
tense
that
is
it
must
be
finite
a
subordinate
clause
is
grammatically
dependent
on
some
element
in
another
clause
it
may
function
as
a
subject
complement
or
modifier
in
the
higher
clause
a
complex
sentence
contains
one
or
more
subordinate
clauses
bolded
e.g
hofstetter
believes
that
he
is
being
targeted
by
homeland
security
agents
in
compound
or
coordinated
sentences
two
or
more
clauses
are
brought
together
as
grammatical
equals
connected
by
a
coordinating
con
junction
bolded
to
one
another
e.g
many
people
can
identify
parts
of
speech
but
they
cannot
justify
their
identification
because
no
clause
in
a
compound
sentence
is
subordinate
to
another
by
definition
all
the
clauses
in
a
com
pound
sentence
are
main
clauses
compound-complex
sentences
are
a
combination
of
complex
and
com
delahunty
and
garvey
pound
sentences
they
may
consist
of
coordinated
clauses
bolded
that
are
subordinate
to
another
clause
e.g
edgeworth
believed
that
novels
should
have
redeeming
social
value
and
that
her
writing
might
help
improve
social
conditions
or
one
or
more
of
the
coordinate
clauses
may
include
one
or
more
subordinate
clauses
bolded
e.g
compound-complex
sentences
consist
of
at
least
two
coordinate
clauses
and
at
least
one
of
those
must
contain
a
clause
which
is
subordinate
to
it
to
orient
ourselves
let’s
recall
that
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
we
distinguished
between
intransitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
are
in
compatible
with
a
direct
object
such
as
cought
laugh
lie
transitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
a
direct
object
such
as
bite
consume
transmit
bi
transitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
a
direct
and
an
indirect
object
such
as
give
offer
send
linking
verbs
i.e
those
that
link
a
subject
with
a
sub
ject
complement
such
as
be
become
seem
and
object
complement
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
both
a
direct
object
and
a
complement
associated
with
that
object
such
as
consider
elect
name
we
revisited
this
subcatego
rization
of
verbs
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
where
we
dealt
with
the
distinct
vps
associated
with
each
type
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
we
added
np
subjects
to
those
vps
to
create
clauses
built
around
each
of
these
verb
types
we
illustrated
objects
with
nps
and
complements
with
nps
and
aps
in
this
chapter
we
substitute
clauses
for
the
nps
that
functioned
in
the
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
as
subjects
direct
objects
indirect
ob
jects
and
subject
and
object
complements
we
will
begin
with
subordinate
finite
clauses
clauses
that
are
marked
for
either
present
or
past
tense
and
move
on
to
non-finite
clauses
those
that
are
not
marked
for
present
or
past
tense
then
we
will
continue
the
discussion
we
began
in
phrases
and
mi
nor
parts
of
speech
on
modifying
clauses
including
relative
clauses
which
are
modifiers
in
nps
and
adverbial
clauses
which
modify
vs
vps
and
clauses
we
wrap
up
this
chapter
with
a
brief
discussion
of
a
few
sentence
types
that
are
designed
to
allow
for
alternative
ways
of
presenting
informa
tion
in
sentences
we
begin
with
a
brief
overview
of
how
one
clause
is
included
within
another
technically
known
as
recursion
recursion
the
possibility
of
creating
multi
clause
sentences
depends
on
a
characteristic
of
language
called
recursion
recursion
is
the
possibility
of
allowing
a
gram
matical
category
to
recur
inside
another
instance
of
the
same
category
for
example
an
np
within
an
np
or
an
s
within
an
s
and
so
on
multi-clause
sentences
a
she
said
something
one
clause
b
she
said
that
i
don’t
know
anything
t
wo
clauses
c
she
said
that
i
don’t
know
what
i
want
three
clauses
d
she
said
that
i
don’t
know
what
i
want
bill
to
do
four
clauses
e
she
said
that
i
don’t
know
what
i
want
bill
to
do
indefinite
number
of
clauses
we
can
represent
this
schematically
as

recursion
is
one
of
the
most
important
characteristics
of
natural
language
because
it
is
the
basis
of
language’s
open-endedness
its
creativity
because
one
clause
can
be
included
embedded
in
another
a
given
sentence
may
have
any
number
of
clauses
the
main
clause
is
the
one
that
is
not
embedded
in
any
other
clause
in
all
the
sentences
of
she
said
x
is
the
main
clause
all
other
clauses
are
subordinate
however
it
should
be
clear
from
that
not
all
subordinate
clauses
are
directly
subordinate
to
the
main
clause—they
may
be
subordinate
to
other
subordinate
clauses
in
s
is
the
main
clause
and
all
the
others
are
subordinate
to
it
however
only

subordinate

complex
sentences
in
this
section
we
will
illustrate
the
range
of
functions
of
subordinate
clauses
using
only
finite
clauses

is
clauses
that
are
marked
as
either
past
or
present
tense
or
that
contain

modal

that
he

convince

jury
of
his

c
that
this
arrangement
may
not
work
out
is
very
upsetting
we
can
apply
our
usual
types
of
tests
to
show
that
these
embedded
clauses
are
subjects
we
can
replace
them
with
ordinary
nps

fact
proves
my
point

notice
that
when
the
subject
of
a
sentence
is
an
embedded
sentence
the
verb
of
that
sentence
is
singular
that
is
sentential
subjects
such
as
those
above
are
regarded
as
singular
exercise
create
five
more
sentences
in
which
a
clause
functions
as
subject
apply
the
np
and
pronoun
tests
described
just
above
to
demonstrate
that
the
subordinate
clauses
really
are
subjects
clauses
that
function
as
direct
objects
the
italicized
clauses
in
are
the
direct
objects
of
the
higher
verb
a
john
claims
he
has
earned
his
first
million
already
b
we
believe
he
exaggerates
a
great
deal
we
can
demonstrate
that
the
embedded
structures
in
typically
called
complement
clauses
are
the
direct
objects
of
the
verbs
like
claim
and
be
lieve
by
using
a
number
of
tests
the
first
test
is
that
nps
substitute
for
them
multi-clause
sentences
a
john
claims
silly
things
b
we
believe
his
exaggerations
we
can
also
substitute
accusative
pronouns
for
them
a
he
claimed
them
b
we
believed
them
the
embedded
clauses
bear
the
same
grammatical
relationship
to
the
verbs
of
their
sentences
as
the
nps
that
replace
them
and
pronouns
that
replace
them
must
be
in
the
accusative
case
these
are
clearly
direct
object
nps
so
the
clauses
they
replace
must
also
be
direct
objects
we
now
introduce
a
slight
complication
to
the
pattern
above
sentences
a,b
can
be
paraphrased
as
a,b
respectively
a
john
claims
that
he
has
earned
his
first
million
already
b
we
believe
that
he
exaggerates
a
great
deal
these
sentences
include
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
embedded
clause
words
that
introduce
clauses
in
this
way
have
various
names
t
radition
ally
as
we
saw
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
that
and
similar
words
has
been
called
a
subordinating
conjunction
because
it
introduces
complement
clauses
many
linguists
refer
to
it
as
a
complementizer
be
cause
the
complementizer
occurs
in
the
comp
position
as
we
described
in
our
chapter
on
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
it
must
be
part
of
the
subordinate
clause
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
whenever
we
move
a
clause
italicized
its
complementizer
bolded
must
move
too
compare
a
and
b
with
a
and
b
respectively
a
it
is
that
he
has
earned
a
million
that
john
claims
b
it
is
that
he
exaggerates
that
we
believe
if
we
leave
the
complementizer
in
its
old
position
italicized
the
result
is
ungrammatical
a
it
is
he
has
earned
a
million
that
john
claims
that
b
it
is
he
exaggerates
that
we
believe
that
when
we
move
elements
we
move
entire
phrases
not
just
parts
of
them
sentences
and
show
that
the
complementizer
is
an
integral
part
of
delahunty
and
garvey
an
embedded
sentence
as
we
hope
you
remember
from
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
the
complementizer
that
must
be
distinguished
from
the
demonstrative
pro
noun
that
the
two
words
just
happen
to
be
spelled
identically
but
within
the
system
of
english
grammar
they
function
rather
differently
the
de
monstrative
that
contrasts
with
this
these
and
those
with
which
it
forms
a
subsystem
within
the
grammar
the
complementizer
that
does
not
contrast
with
the
demonstratives
there
are
no
sentences
of
english
in
which
an
em
bedded
clause
is
introduced
by
this

complementizer

formal
differences
between
them
too
which
we
deal
with
below
we
begin
by
illustrating
some
of
the
variety
of
restrictive
relatives
multi-clause
sentences
a
the
man
that
we
bought
the
boat
from
skipped
town
b
the
man
who(m
we
bought
the
boat
from
skipped
town
c
the
man
from
whom
we
bought
the
boat
skipped
town
d
the
man
whose
boat
we
bought
skipped
town
e
the
man
we
bought
the
boat
from
skipped
town
we
want
you
to
notice
a
number
of
features
of
these
clauses
first
the
finite
rcs
can
be
introduced
by
that
a
a
wh-word
b
a
phrase
con
taining
a
wh-word
c,d
or
no
introducer
at
all
e
second
each
of
the
relative
clauses
has
a
gap
a
position
which
if
the
clause
were
rephrased
as
a
complete
sentence
would
have
to
be
filled
in
the
sentences
in
we
indicate
the
gap
as
e
in
a
the
part
of
the
np
that
is
modified
by
the
rc
the
man
is
interpreted
as
the
subject
of
the
rc
so
the
gap
is
in
the
rc
subject
position
in
b
the
part
of
the
np
modified
by
the
rc
the
boat
is
interpreted
as
the
direct
object
of
the
rc
so
that
the
gap
is
in
the
rc
do
position
in
c
d
the
part
of
the
np
modified
by
the
rc
the
man
is
interpreted
as
the
object
of
a
preposition
in
the
rc
so
the
gap
occurs
after
the
preposition
in
each
case
this
claim
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
preposition
is
not
followed
immediately
by
its
object
indicating
that
the
gap
is
the
op
position
a
the
man
that/who
e
sold
us
the
boat
skipped
town
subject
b
the
boat
that/which
the
man
sold
us
e
broke
down
direct
object
c
the
man
that/who
we
sold
the
boat
to
e
is
very
upset
object
of
preposition
d
the
man
that/who
we
bought
the
boat
from
e
skipped
town
object
of
preposition
third
the
wh-word
is
interpreted
as
coreferential
with
i.e
referring
to
the
same
entity
as
the
head
noun
and
any
other
modifiers
of
the
np
that
contains
the
rc
if
we
were
to
rephrase
the
relative
clauses
in
as
independent
sentences
we
would
replace
the
relative
pronouns
where
they
occur
with
the
head
noun
and
any
modifiers
giving
us
a
the
man
sold
us
the
boat
b
the
man
sold
us
the
boat
c
we
sold
the
boat
to
the
man
d
we
bought
the
boat
from
the
man
delahunty
and
garvey
fourth
if
the
rc
contains
a
wh
phrase
then
that
phrase
is
coreferential
with
the
gap
in
the
rc
we
indicate
coreferentiality
by
identical
subscripts
a
the
man]i
whomi
we
bought
the
boat
from
ei
skipped
town
b
the
man]i
from
whomi]j
we
bought
the
boat
ej
skipped
town
if
there
is
no
introducer
or
if
the
introducer
is
that
then
the
head
n
and
any
modifiers
is
directly
coreferential
with
the
gap
the
man]i
that
we
bought
the
boat
from
ei
skipped
town
fifth
if
the
wh-word
is
the
genitive
whose
then
the
rest
of
the
np
modi
fied
by
whose
must
move
to
the
comp
position
along
with
whose
a
the
man
whose
boat
we
bought
skipped
town
b
the
man
whose
we
bought
boat
skipped
town
sixth
if
the
wh-word
is
governed
by
a
preposition
then
the
preposition
may
or
may
not
move
to
the
front
of
the
sentence
with
it
as
in
a,b
a
the
man
from
whom
we
bought
the
boat
skipped
town
b
the
man
whom
we
bought
the
boat
from
skipped
town
if
the
introducer
of
the
relative
is
that
or
if
there
is
no
introducer
then
no
movement
of
the
preposition
can
take
place
as
the
ungrammaticality
of
a,b
shows
a
the
man
from
that
we
bought
the
boat
skipped
town
b
the
man
from
we
bought
the
boat
skipped
town
some
grammarians
call
both
the
wh-words
and
that
relative
pronouns
this
appears
to
us
to
ignore
differences
between
them
such
as
the
ones
we
just
noted
we
will
therefore
distinguish
between
wh-words
which
are
true
pronouns
and
that
which
we
have
called
a
complementizer
that
as
a
com
plementizer
is
morphologically
invariant
and
appears
only
at
the
begin
nings
of
subordinate
clauses
the
restrictive
relatives
clauses
that
we
have
been
examining
are
typically
interpreted
as
providing
information
necessary
for
identifying
the
referent
of
the
entire
np
another
kind
of
relative
clause
the
non-restrictive
sup
plies
extra
information
that
is
not
considered
necessary
to
identify
the
refer
multi-clause
sentencesent
of
the
np
a
the
claim
which
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
b
the
claim
which
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
the
non-restrictive
relative
a
refers
to
some
claim
and
then
adds
the
supplementary
information
that
the
claim
is
fully
supported
by
the
evi
dence
the
reader/hearer
is
assumed
to
know
which
claim
is
being
referred
to
without
this
extra
information
the
restrictive
relative
b
refers
to
a
claim
that
is
assumed
to
be
identifiable
only
by
using
the
information
in
the
relative
clause
to
distinguish
the
intended
claim
from
other
claims
one
syntactic
effect
of
this
difference
between
restrictive
and
non
restrictive
relatives
is
that
the
head
of
a
non-restrictive
but
generally
not
of
a
restrictive
may
be
a
proper
noun
a
bill
who
is
well
known
to
all
of
us
will
sing
his
favorite
tune
home
on
the
range
b
bill
who
is
well
known
to
all
of
us
will
sing
his
favorite
tune
home
on
the
range
one
explanation
for
this
is
that
the
referents
of
proper
nouns
are
assumed
to
be
identifiable
by
hearers/readers
without
extra
information
restrictive
relatives
whose
information
is
assumed
to
be
essential
for
the
identification
of
the
referent
are
therefore
redundant
with
proper
nouns
non-restric
tive
relatives
modifying
proper
nouns
whose
information
is
assumed
to
be
supplementary
are
not
redundant
we
do
however
find
sentences
such
as
the
following
which
might
be
used
in
a
situation
in
which
there
are
several
individuals
called
bill
in
that
case
the
usual
assumption
associated
with
proper
names
may
be
suspended
and
the
specific
bill
being
referred
to
can
be
identified
by
a
restrictive
clause
the
bill
who
has
the
rose
between
his
teeth
we
turn
now
to
some
formal
differences
between
restrictive
and
non
restrictive
relatives
that
we
mentioned
above
restrictive
relative
clauses
may
be
introduced
by
either
a
wh-word
that
or
zero
non-restrictive
clauses
may
be
introduced
only
by
wh-words
a
mr
pferdfeld
whom
we
have
just
met
b
mr
pferdfeld
that
we
have
just
met
delahunty
and
garvey
c
mr
pferdfeld
we
have
just
met
moreover
restrictive
relative
clauses
may
be
moved
away
from
the
nouns
they
modify
but
non-restrictives
may
not
a
a
man
who
was
from
iceland
came
in
b
a
man
came
in
who
was
from
iceland
a
bill
who
was
from
iceland
came
in
b
bill
came
in
who
was
from
iceland
we
should
also
mention
here
that
other
modifiers
in
nps
can
be
restrictive
or
non-restrictive
such
as
pps
a
dell
computers
with
touch-screen
capability
b
dell
computers
with
touch-screen
capability
so
far
we
have
described
only
full
finite
relative
clauses
however
we
also
find
reduced
relative
clauses
the
man

near
the
entrance

my
father
can
be
interpreted
as
an
elliptical
version
of
the
man
who
is
standing
near
the
entrance
is
my
father
reduction
of
this
sort
is
common
when
the
implied
material
is
a
wh-word
and
an
inflected
form
of
be
which
as
we
saw
before
is
referred
to
as
whiz
deletion
reduced
relatives
may
also
function
as
non-restrictive
modifiers

conditional
clauses
conditionals
are
particularly
important
for
esl
students
and
are
included
in
all
esl
textbooks
the
subordinate

typically
introduced
by
if
or
when
describes
a
condition
that
must
be
met
if
the
situation
in
the
main

is

discussions
of
conditionals
usually
divide
them
into
two
major
types
the
hypothetical

finite

clauses
consider
now
the
formal
differences
between
the
italicized
clauses
in
the
following
sentences
a
we
think
the
ghost
appears
at
midnight
b
we
want
the
ghost
to
appear
at
midnight
we
can
see
that
both
are
clauses
since
each
has
a
subject
np
the
ghost
and
a
vp
appear/s
at
midnight
however
the
italicized
clause
in
a
is
a
finite
clause
it
is
in
the
present
tense
and
its
subject
agrees
with
its
verb
we
could
even
include
a
modal
in
it
we
think
the
ghost
will
appear
at
midnight
multi-clause
sentencesin
contrast
the
non-finite
clauses
like
those
in
b
do
not
allow
for
agree
ment
or
modals
a
we

the
ghost

d
the

must

e
the
bones
must

by
the
term
finite
then
we
mean
that
a
clause
is
marked
with
a
present
or
past
tense
inflection
or
includes
a
modal
auxiliary
an
easy
way
to
spot
a
finite
clause
is
to
look
at
its
first
verb
if
it
is
in
the
present
or
past
tense
or
if
it
is
a
modal
then
the
clause
is
finite
otherwise

we
distinguish
two
types
of
participles—ving
a.k.a
present
participles
and
ven
a.k.a
past
participles
both
act
as
noun
modifiers
the
first
verb
of
a
present
participle
is
a
ving
verb
a

whoever
wants
it
b
anyone

to
get
on

the
first
verb
of
a
past
participle
is
in
the
ven
form
the
bones

many
participles
can
be
paraphrased
as
full
tensed
clauses

b
anyone
who
is
hoping
to
get
on
the
boat
c
the
bones
which
were
gnawed
by

participles
may
often
be
viewed
as
reductions
of
these
full
tensed
clauses
by
whiz
deletion
however
when
the
verb
of
the
participle
is
a
state
verb
such
as
resemble
the

participle
and
a

are

have
all
occurred

modify

do
however

may
occur

we’ll
call
them

an
analogous
omission

in

however
the
terms
past

a
name
which
suggest
that
the

been
moved
posed

extra
its
normal
position
we
have
already
exemplified
another
construction
in
which
a

extraposed

repeat
our
example
here
for
convenience
a
a
man

a

again
both
sentences
have
identical

in

the
relative
clause
modifying
man
appears
at
the
end
of
the
predicate
the
rule
that
links
these
two
sentence
types
is
called
extraposition
from
np
one
reason
why
english
and
many
other
languages
allows
extraposition
and
extraposition
from
np
is
that
clauses
tend
to
be
relatively
long
and
so
if
they
are
not
moved
they
may
disrupt
the
subject
predicate
structure
of
the
sentences
in
which
they
are
subordinate
sentences
are
generally
somewhat
easier
to
process
understand
when
the
clause
has
been
extraposed
another
reason
might
be
that
while
nps
require
case
marking
subordinate
clauses
do
not
and
so
may
be
moved
to
positions
that
do
not
receive

by

or
more
accurately
displaced
it
appears
as
the
subject
of
the
main
clause
note
too
that
the
main
clause
subject
of
a
is
the
expletive
it
this
it
does
not
refer
to
anything
and
occupies
a
position
that
receives
no
semantic
role
which
is
why
it
is
an
expletive
or
dummy
hilda
on
the
other
hand
receives
its
thematic
role
from
the
subordinate
verb
and
prepo
sition
it
is
as
if
hilda
had
been
moved
from
the
position
marked
e
in
the
subordinate
clause
into
the
higher
subject
around
the
adjective
tough
hence
the
name
tough
movement
as
another
example
compare
it
is
distressing
to
have
to
deal
with
wasps
and
wasps
are
distressing
to
have
to
deal
with
a
very
reasonable
question
to
ask
at
this
point
would
be
why
does
eng
lish
maintain
pairs
of
sentences
such
as
a
b
and
a
b
whose
mem
bers
have
identical
meanings
while
we
do
not
have
a
definitive
answer
we
multi-clause
sentencesbelieve
that
the
reason
has
to
do
with
the
discourse
functions
of
subjects
typically
though
by
no
means
always
subjects
function
as
the
topics
of
their
sentences
topics
refer
to
the
entities
that
the
sentences
are
about
so
b
is
about
oscar
in
a
way
that
a
is
not
similarly
b
is
about
hilda
whereas
a
is
not
we
would
use
the
b
sentences
of
these
pairs
in
discourse
contexts
slightly
different
from
the
contexts
in
which
we
would
use
the
a
versions
we
turn
now
to
a
pair
of
sentence
types
that
have
characteristics
akin
to
finite
relative
clauses
the
it-cleft
and
pseudo
cleft
constructions
it-clefting
the
following
is
an
it-cleft
sentence
and
we
will
refer
to
the
phrase
in
square
brackets
as
its
focus
and
to
the
italicized
clause
simply
as
its
clause
it
was
henry
ford
who
invented
the
assembly
line
clefts
consist
of
an
expletive
it
higher
subject
a
form
of
be
a
focus
phrase
which
may
be
any
phrase
type
except
vp
and
a
clause
that
looks
like
but
actually
isn’t
a
finite
relative
clause
the
clause
is
like
a
relative
in
that
it
may
be
introduced
by
a
wh-word
that
or
in
some
cases
nothing
at
all
it
was
henry
ford
who/that/zero
invented
the
assembly
line
it
also
contains
a
gap
which
is
interpreted
as
if
it
were
filled
by
the
focus
phrase
so
that
the
clefts
above
mean
in
essence
henry
ford
invented
the
assembly
line
the
fact
that
a
cleft
can
be
reduced
in
this
way
has
led
some
grammarians
to
suggest
that
the
focus
was
actually
moved
out
of
the
clause
into
its
position
in
the
higher
clause
cleft
foci
are
often
interpreted
as
contrasting
with
some
other
phrase
for
example
you
might
use
a
cleft
such
as
the
ones
above
if
you
thought
that
the
audience
believed
that
roger
smith
invented
the
assembly
line
it
was
henry
ford
not
roger
smith
who
invented
the
assembly
line
if
the
focus
is
a
pp
then
the
sense
of
contrast
may
fade
somewhat
delahunty
and
garvey
it
was
in
that
the
french
revolution
broke
out
the
construction
here
suggests
something
like
specifically
in
but
could
also
be
used
if
a
hearer
believed
that
the
french
revolution
broke
out
in
or
the
clause
of
a
cleft
sentence
is
usually
interpreted
as
known
information
known
either
to
the
hearer
or
by
people
generally
it
is
not
however

to
be
currently

we

refer

to
the

c

again
the
basic
meaning
may

represented
by
a

which
the

replaces

as

she
would

iso
lation
not
be

but
personal
discomfort
bothered
her
only
insofar
as
it
kept
her
from

she
had
trained
herself
to
withstand
any
discomfort
that
could
come
along
discomforts
of
either
body
or
mind
the
mind
was
more
difficult
being
limitless
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
the
stars
in
the
course
of
her
studies
she
had
read
that
what
fueled
the
stars
was
the
merging

science
what
fascinated
her
was
the
notion
that

easily

concluding
remarks
in
this
chapter
we
explored
the
major
grammatical
structures
that
enable
english
speakers
to
create
sentences
of
infinite
length
and
complexity
de
spite
the
intricacy
and
variety
they
make
possible
finite
and
non-finite
sub
ordinate
clauses
are
individually
fairly
simple
each
has
a
rather
limited
set
of
formal
properties
and
we
have
had
to
add
very
few
functions
to
describe
their
workings
but
the
process
of
embedding—of
building
structures
with
in
structures—multiplies
the
potential
for
variety
exponentially
we
have
only
scratched

surface
of
that
potential

the

addresses
writing
studies
in
a
broad
sense
consistent
with
the
wide

approaches
characteristic
of
teaching
and

in
writing
across

the

presents
works
that
take
divergent
perspectives
on
working
as
a
writer
teaching

administering
writing

who
these
books
are
for
this
is
the
first
of
two
books
for
teachers
about
the
english
language
we
be
lieve
that
all
teachers
not
just
english
teachers
share
the
responsibility
for
helping
students
develop
their
abilities
to
speak
read
and
write
students
must
learn
to
communicate
appropriately
about
math
chemistry
history
and
every
other
school
subject
teaching
students
these
skills
necessarily
ex
tends
across

thus
while
one
part

our
intended
audience
is
english
k-12
teachers
we
have
prepared
this
book
and
its
companion
with
teachers
and
student
teachers
from
all
disciplines
in
mind
how
to
use
these
books
in
these
books
we
use
certain
typographical
marks
to
help
you
focus
on
key
points
important
terms
are
bolded
you
can

what
these
books
are
about
these
books
are
about
language
but
specifically
about
the
english
language
delahunty
and
garvey
4and
its
uses
the
first
book
is
about
the
grammar
of
english
the
second
is
about
related
topics
including
language
variation
e.g
dialects
language
learning
english
spelling
and
the
history
of
the
english
language
generally
when
people
hear
the
word
grammar
they
immediately
think
of
correct
or
incorrect
and
good
or
bad
language
thinking
about
language
in
this
way
is
said
to
be
prescriptive
english
has
a
long
tradition
of
judging
some
expressions
as
correct
and
others
as
incorrect
for
example
expressions
such
as
we
was
are
viewed
as
incorrect
even
though
a
great
many
people
use
them
the
correct
version
is
said
to
be
we
were
counter-posed
to
the
prescriptive
tradition
is
the
descriptive
one
which
developed
in
linguistics
anthropology
and
sociology
this
approach
is
concerned
with
describing
and
understanding
the
linguistic
behavior
of
a
community
without
judging
it
from
a
descriptive
point
of
view
we
was
is
unobjectionable
when
used
by
a
member
of
a
community
of
speakers
who
characteristically
use
this
expression
however
it
is
unacceptable
to
the
wider
english
speaking
community
in
for
example
formal
speaking
and
writing
the
point
of
view
presented
in
these
books
is
essentially
descriptive
however
except
where
the
topic
is
explicitly
about
linguistic
variation
we
describe
the
form
of
english
used
in
relatively
formal
public
speaking
and
writing
we
recognize
that
language
changes
and
that
consequently
even
the
prescriptive
rules
have
to
change
we
believe
that
these
rules
should
be
descriptions
of
the
best
accepted
practices
of
the
day
rather
than
imposi
tions
often
irrelevant
on
the
language
and
its
use
communication
communication
occurs
when
one
person
acts
with
the
intention
of
influ
encing
the
mind
of
another
for
example
by
getting
him/her
to
entertain
some
idea
and
when
that
other
person
recognizes
the
first
person’s
inten
tion
to
influence
his/her
mind
clearly
it
is
possible
to
influence
another
person’s
mind
unintentionally
for
instance
if
i
unintentionally
sneeze
i
might
prompt
you
to
think
that
i
might
have
a
cold
however
this
is
a
rather
different
kind
of
event
than
one
in
which
i
intentionally
sneeze
and
you
recognize
that
my
sneeze
was
intentional
from
my
first
unintentional
sneeze
you
cannot
infer
that
i
am
trying
to
get
you
to
think
i
have
a
cold
from
my
second
intentional
sneeze
you
can
infer
that
i
am
trying
to
get
you
to
think
something
or
another
perhaps
that
i
have
a
cold
imagine
that
we
have
gone
to
a
party
together
and
that
we
want
to
co
ordinate
our
leaving
so
before
we
get
to
the
party
i
say
to
you
i’ll
pre

introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languagetend
to
sneeze
when
i’m
ready
to
go
home
and
you
agree
to
interpret
my
sneeze
in
this
way
when
i
sneeze
at
the
party
you
can
infer
that
i
sneezed
intentionally
and
interpret
my
sneeze
as
indicating
my
desire
to
leave
for
this
communication
to
succeed
two
elements
must
be
in
place
first
the
assumption
that
i
intend
to
influence
you
in
some
way
and
sec
ond
our
agreement
about
the
meaning
of
my
intentional
sneeze
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
sneeze
that
requires
it
to
mean
let’s
go
home
we
could
have
agreed
that
it
was
to
mean
it’s
safe
to
slip
upstairs
to
steal
the
host’s
jewelry
by
specifying
a
meaning
for
a
sneeze
we
have
created
a
little
code
a
sort
of
miniscule
language
language
fortunately
we
cannot
read
each
others’
minds
so
if
we
want
to
allow
some
one
access
to
what
we
are
thinking
we
must
provide
them
with
clues
that
they
can
perceive
language
is
a
system
that
connects
thoughts
which
can
not
be
heard
seen
or
touched
with
sounds
letters
manual
signs
or
tactile
symbols
e.g
braille
which
can
in
this
way
one
person’s
private
ideas
may
be
communicated
to
another
person
for
example
imagine
that
i
want
to
communicate
to
you
my
idea
that
my
study
needs
to
be
tidied
up
you
can’t
see
hear
touch
taste
or
otherwise
perceive
that
idea
it’s
locked
away
in
my
mind
to
communicate
it
to
you
i
have
to
cast
it
in
a
form
that
you
can
perceive—typically
in
spoken
visual
or
tactile
form—that
is
systematically
connected
to
the
idea
for
example
the
sentence
my
study
needs
to
be
tidied
up
without
this
perceivable
expression
you
cannot
know
that
i
have
an
idea
to
communicate
without
the
systematic
connection
between
the
idea
and
the
form
of
the
expression
you
cannot
know
which
idea
i
want
to
communicate
so
language
is
a
code
that
systematically
connects
private
thoughts
with
pub
lic
expressions
these
books
are
about
the
systems
we
use
to
connect
private
ideas
to
public
activities
language
has
been
a
major
topic
of
research
for
well
over
two
centuries
linguistic
research
intersects
with
anthropology
biology
computer
science
history
human
development
literature
philosophy
politics
psychology
as
well
as
reading
and
writing
discourse
when
we
communicate
we
engage
in
discourse
that
is
we
deploy
language
with
the
purpose
of
providing
our
audiences
with
clues
about
how
we
want
to
influence
them
all
discourse
takes
place
in
context
that
is
the
producer
of
a
piece
of
discourse
speaker/writer
purposefully
deploys
at
some
time
and
in
some
delahunty

garvey
6place
clues
about
his
or
her
intention
which
are
to
be
interpreted
by
their
intended
recipient(s
audience
the
clues
have
generally
been
selected
with
that
audience
in
that
time
and
place
and
with
those
purposes
in
mind
some
scholars
argue
that
because
different
discourse
situations
require
different
patterns
of
communicative
practice
we
must
speak
of
discours
es
rather
than
of

we
have
for
instance
the
discourse
in
which
we
are
currently
engaged—the
discourse
of
linguistics
which
differs
from
the
discourse
of
literary
study
which
differs
from
the
dis
course
of
chemical
engineering
which
differs
from
the
discourse
of
history
and
so
on
a
student
who
aims
to
be
a
practitioner
in
a
field
must
master
the
ways
in
which
practitioners
in
that
field
communicate
with
each
other
about
topics
in
the
field
recognizing
these
specialized
communicative
practices
has
given
rise
to
the
writing
across
the
curriculum

movement
text
when
people
communicate
they
produce
texts
texts
always
occur
in
some
medium
which
may
be
auditory
visual
tactile
or
some
combina
tion
of
these
texts
also
always
occur
in
some
channel
that
is
the
environ
ment
through
which
the
medium
travels
from
the
text’s
producer(s
to
its
receiver(s
for
ordinary
face-to

conversation
the
medium
is
the
air
which
is
set
in
motion
by
the
producer
and
whose
motions
affect
the
ears
of
the

communication

involves
at

the

and

that

as

a
genre
is
a
communicative
category
genres
differ
from
each
other
in

texts
come
in
genres
for
example
a
shakespear
ean
sonnet
is
a
different
type
of
text
from
a
business
letter
which
is
a
different
type
of
text
from
a
casual
conversation
communicative
acts
come
in
genres
too
the
sales
pitch
of
a
car
salesman
differs
from
an
end-of-term
class
presentation
which
differs
from
texting
a
party
invitation
to
a
friend
the
various
discourses
require
their
own
specific
genres
for
example
the
discourse
of
creative
writing
in
english
includes
the
genres
of
the
short
story
the
novel
and
poetry
which
includes
such
sub-genres
as
the
lyric
and
the
dramatic
monologue
the
discourse
of

includes
the
annual

various
kinds
of

and

introduction
to
the
linguistic
study
of
languageideology
many
scholars
stress
the
power
of
discourse
and
language
to
influence
speak
ers’
perceptions
and
conceptualizations
of
their
worlds
and
to
create
and
maintain
the
structures
of
their
societies
educators
interested
in
language
emphasize
its
power
to
create
and
maintain
ideologies
i.e
beliefs
about
the
ways
in
which
goods
are
distributed
in
society
goods
are
anything
that
the
people
in
the
society
generally
believe
are
beneficial
to
have
or
harmful
not

language
in
education
language
is
central
to
education
it
is
the
means
by
which
educational
con
tent
is
communicated
it
is
an
object
of
study
it
is
an
object
of
beliefs
that
are
important
in
education
it
is
a
key
element
of
students’
identities
it
poses
potential
problems
in
education
largely
because
of
the
beliefs
we
have
about
it
and
it
is
a
valuable
resource
for
those
who
know
how
to
make
use
of
it
language
is
a
means
of
education
in
that
it
is
the
primary
medium
of
communication
between
students
and
teachers
and
between
students
and
textbooks
language
is
an
object
of
education
because
it
is
the
material
out
of
which
texts
are
woven
and
because
language
itself
is
the
object
of
study
in
writ
ing
and
speaking
courses
we
focus
on
language
as
we
learn
to
edit
our
essays
and
speeches
we
develop
our
vocabularies
and
learn
the
meanings
uses
and
conventional
spellings
of
words
we
learn
to
control
the
genres
required
for
various
disciplines
and
the
specific
characteristics
expected
in
those
genres
for
example
personal
essays
academic
papers
of
various
sorts
business
letters
reports
and
magazine
articles
language
is
also
an
object
of
study
in
so
far
as
we
develop
our
skills
in
using
it
to
communicate
to
acquire
knowledge
from
lectures
and
books
to
integrate
new
information
with
old
to
replace
false
beliefs
with
new
true
ones
and
to
increase
or
de
crease
our
estimates
of
the
likelihood
that
some
belief
we
hold
is
true
it
is
important
to
note
here
that
students
who
are
learning
english
as
a
sec
ond
language
labor
under
a
double
burden
because
english
is
simultaneously
both
the
means
and
an
object
of
their
education
exercise
when
asked
what
she
thought
was
the
most
important
aspect
of
learn
ing
english
as
a
second
language
a
japanese
student
replied
knowing
delahunty
and
garvey
8many
vocabularies
what
do
you
think
she
meant
is
her
expression
an
acceptable
piece
of
english
how
would
you
change
it
so
it
retains
her
apparent
meaning
and
is
acceptable
why
would
you
make
that
par
ticular
change
is
your
understanding
of
her
assertion
true
language
is
also
an
object
of
our
beliefs
many
people
believe
that
some
forms
of
english
are
good
and
others
bad
that
some
languages
are
beautiful
and
others
ugly
that
some
languages
are
limited
in
what
they
can
express
when
compared
to
languages
such
as
english
that
people
who
speak
certain
varieties
are
uneducated
perhaps
stupid
and
unworthy
of
certain
types
of
work
beliefs
like
these
constitute
ideologies
about
language
some
ideolo
gies
are
liberating
and
others
quite
oppressive
whether
liberating
or
op
pressive
they
must
become
objects
of
critical
awareness
for
teachers
and
of
critical
discussion
for
students

language
also
represents
one
of
the
key
elements
of
our
students’
social
cultural
and
personal
identities
writing
explores
values
our
students
may
not
be
able
to
explore
otherwise
as
their
writing
improves
the
range
and
sophistication
of
these
identities
increases
teachers
have
potentially
powerful
effects
on
students’
lives
our
re
sponse
to
our
students’
language
will
influence
their
attitudes
young
chil
dren
have
a
fascination
with
language
and
almost
no
inhibitions
about
it
adults
in
contrast
typically
display
considerable
anxiety
about
their
language
they
often
have
strongly
negative
attitudes
towards
their
native
speech
pattern

this
anxiety
is
known
as
linguistic
in
security
this
insecurity
does
not
develop
naturally
it
is
the
consequence
of
repeated
experiences
in
which
their
native
speech
patterns
are
dispar
aged
often
by
teachers
who
should
know
better
this

is

how
many

i.e

then
estimate
your

that

which
don’t
come

to

when
you

prestidigitation
estimates
based
on
objective
study
appear
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
language
is
a
potential
problem
to
the
extent
that
it—or
our
beliefs
about
it—impedes
students’
learning
if
we
believe
that
students
who
speak
english
with
a
latino
accent
or
who
speak
black
english
a.k.a
ebonics
will
be
unable
to
keep
up
in
our
classes
then
very
likely
they
will
not
because
teach
ers’
expectations
strongly
affect
students’
success
in
school
because
teachers
respond
to
students’
language
on
many
levels
they
must
develop
a
critical
awareness
of
their
own
linguistic
preferences
prejudices
and
beliefs—ev
eryone
has
these
beliefs
even
linguists
they
must
also
be
able
to
critically
evaluate
textbooks
dictionaries
style
manuals
computerized
style
analyzers
and
newspaper
articles
on
language
because
these
also
embody
assumptions
about
language
many
of
them
just
plain
wrong
often
destructively
so
language
is
a
potential
resource
for
teaching
critical
thinking
we
can
evalu
ate
our
attitudes
about
other
languages
and
other
dialects
and
their
speak
ers
we
can
collect
linguistic
data
observe
its
patterns
and
articulate
those
patterns
as
hypotheses
which
we
can
then
test
we
can
evaluate
the
ways
we
talk
about
language
for
their
precision
and
come
to
appreciate
the
value
of
precision
in
language
use
generally
language
data
for
analysis
is
very
readily
available
students
can
collect
their
own
data
from
bumper

schools
or
the

can
provide
comput
erized
collections
of
authentic
spoken
and
written
texts
corpora
along
with
computer
programs
to
analyze
them

because
the
linguistic
study
of

is
fundamentally
scientific

in

and

with
an
understanding

must
know
about

as
well
as
about

but
why
should
they
learn
about

one
answer
is
that
teachers
should
have
a
well-developed
critical
understand
ing
of
at
least
some
modern
thinking
about
the
nature
of
language
and
its
roles
in

to

about

critical

we

both
of
these
tasks
require
at

minimum
knowing
the

technical
terms
some

may
require

when

students
think
critically
when
they
analyze
their
personal
preconceptions
and
biases
when
they
assess
the
relevance
and
effectiveness
of
their
ideas
and
when
they
decide
on
the
best
linguistic
formulation
of
those
ideas
for
their
intended
audiences
the
ability
to
think
critically
about
language
is
particularly
needed
now
because
the
school
grammar
tradition
has
generally
become
quite
unin
formed
about
research
into
current
english
discourse
practices
the
respon
sibility
for
this
situation
lies
partly
with
linguists
themselves
we
have
not
been
successful
in
our
efforts
to
educate
the
public
about
language
how
ever
the
greatest
share
of
the
responsibility
lies
with
institutions
journalists
and
teachers
who
have
vigorously
defended
an
ultra-conservative
status
quo
who
know
little
if
anything
about
language
and
who
often
misconstrue
what
linguists
have
to
say
about
it
many
believe
for
instance
that
linguists
claim
that
anything
goes
in
english
these
days
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
as
we
will
show
in
our
chapter
on
conceptions

standard

learning
to

who
concern
themselves
with

typically
view

as

to

by
saying
that
grammar
tells
us
which
expressions
are
correct
you
would
of
course
have
meant
prescrip
tive
grammar
however
linguists
add
at
least
two
other
interpretations
to
the
word
first
they
use
it
to
refer
to
the
knowledge
that
a
speaker
or
writer
of
a
language
must
have
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
the
language
at
all
second
they
use
it
to
refer
to
any
attempt
to
describe
that
knowledge
we
will
return
to
these
issues
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
discuss
prescriptive
and
descrip
tive
approaches
to
language
study
more
thoroughly
it
is
important
when
we
speak
about
grammar
that
we
are
clear
to
ourselves
and
our
audiences
which
meaning
of
grammar
we
intend
this
first
book
is
about
the
grammar
of
english
some
of
our
readers
will
be
required
to
teach
grammar
classes
per
se
others
will
use
information
about
english
grammar
while
teaching
composition
and
still
others
will
use
it
while
teaching
writing-intensive
classes
across
the
curriculum
it
is
important
to
note
that
grammar
refers
only
to
a
part
of
language
and
that
these
books
deal
with
language
not
just
grammar
we
believe
that
a
teacher’s
knowledge
of
language
is
far
more
broadly
relevant
than
just
knowledge
of
grammar
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
teaching
grammar
is
highly
con
troversial
to
get
a
sense
of
the
arguments
we
recommend
that
you

neither
you
nor
we
can
predict
what
you
will
believe
about
language
grammar
and
the
teaching
of
either
by
the
time
you
have
read
these
books
however
we
do
know
that
in
discussions
about
how
to
teach
writing
you
will
hear
arguments
that
teaching
grammar
out
of
context
does
not
improve
students’
writing
generally
what
is
meant
by
grammar
in
those
discussions
is
the
set
of
pre
scriptive
conventions
for
speaking
and
writing
standard
english
certainly
there
is
a
large
body
of
research
going
back
more
than
a
century
purporting
to
support
this
position
however
we
repeat
these
books
are
not
just
about
grammar
they
are
about
language
including
how
grammar
fits
into
lan
guage
it
is
as
important
for
teachers
to
know
about
language
as
it
is
to
know
about
their
subject
matter
a
teacher
who
knows
nothing
about
language
is
a
cyclist
without
wheels
worse
a
teacher
who
knows
nothing
about
lan
guage
is
a
chemist
who
knows
and
cares
nothing
about
the
environmental
consequences
of
the
substances
he
or
she
creates
our
approach
to
the
study
of
language
is
heavily
influenced
by
the
results
of
recent
linguistic
research
and
methods
this
allows
us
to
tie
our
discussion
to
critical
thinking
literature
writing
across
the
curriculum
and
composi
tion
studies
as
well
as
to
philosophy
and

and

sciences
see
t
raugott
and
pratt
1980
as
well
as
journals
like
english
journal
and
style
most
of
this
book
deals
with
english
grammar
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
general
public
expects
teachers
to
have
a
mastery
of
grammar
by
which
is
usually
meant
prescriptive
grammar
you
will
probably
be
expected
to
teach
the
subject
in
one
way
or
another
we
do
not
suggest
that
you
use
this
book
as
a
syllabus
it
contains
too
much
material
and
is
not
geared
to
a
junior
or
senior
high-school
audience
nonetheless
in
spite
of
the
amount
of
material
it
covers
it’s
merely
a
good
basis
for
continuing
your
study
of
language
we
hope
that
you
will
find
the
analytic
and
critical
methods
of
exploring
language
used
in
the
books
to
be
more
productive
and
interesting
than
the
more
con
ventional
handbook
approach—exposition
plus
drill-and-practice
more
importantly
we
hope
that
you
will
present
to
your
students
the
broader
conceptions
about
language
that
are
expressed
in
these
books
these
conceptions
are
presented
initially
in
our
chapter
on
conceptions
of
language
but
are
developed
in
various
ways

14other
reasons
for
studying
and
teaching
about
language
besides
its
importance
in
the
development
of
critical
thinking
skills
there
are
many
other
reasons
for
studying
language
you
might
want
to
know
about
language
variation
dialects
of
various
sorts
about
how
languages
change
over
time
about
the
history
of
english
about
the
standardization
of
languages
about
how
languages
are
learned
about
language
disorders
about
the
relationships
between
language
and
culture
or
society
or
about
how
computers
are
programmed
to
understand
or
produce
language
these
are
all
to
one
degree
or
another
relevant
to
teachers
and
we
deal
with
many
of
them
in
these
books
deciding
what
should
be
included
in
books
like
these
is
remarkably
dif
ficult
we
have
followed
the
guidelines
of
the
national
council
of
teachers
of
english
ncte
and
the
national
council
for
accreditation
for
teacher
education
ncate
about
what
english
teachers
should
know
and
we
depended
on
the
research
on
writing
across
the
curriculum
wac
none
theless
because
such
a
huge
amount
is
known
about
language
generally
and
about
english
in
particular
and
because
as
in
any
area
of
vigorous
intellectual
activity
there
are
many
competing
approaches
to
these
topics
it
would
be
impossible
to
synopsize
them
all
here
in
the
first
book
we
pres
ent
a
grammar
of
english
which
addresses
traditional
topics
and
concerns
but
which
is
influenced
considerably
by
current
grammatical
and
discourse
research
in
the
second
book
we
present
a
range
of
topics
that
we
hope
will
be
of
interest
and
value
to
teachers
across
the
disciplines

physical

business
or
in
other
intellectual
pursuits
unfortunately
however
many
students
and
teachers
see
the
study
of
language
as
merely
the
study
of
correct
grammar
we
have
already
begun
to
sift
through
the
various
meanings
of
grammar
and
will
develop
this
discussion
in

chapters
teachers
face

that

lag

of

the

of
these

the
next
chapter
of
this
book
conceptions
of

is
on
the
nature
of
language
the
remaining
chapters
are
on
various
aspects
of
the
english
language
including
its
sound
system
its
vocabulary
its
parts
of
speech
word
meanings
and
the
ways
in
which
words
are
combined
into
phrases
clauses
and
sentences—essentially
the
grammar
of
english
book
i
gives
you
some
basic
information
about
english
grammar
about
how
to
do
simple
linguistic
analyses
and
about
thinking
critically
about
language
because
it
is
impossible
to
remember
the
analysis
of
every
expres
sion
you
might
be
asked
about
by
a

there
are
far
too
many
our
main
concern
is
to
help
you
become
independent
by
providing
you
with
the
means
to
do
linguistic
analysis
as
you
need

we
regularly
use
an
analytic
method
in
which
we
formulate
criteria
for
determining
how
to
categorize
words
phrases
or
sentences
for
example
whenever
we
want
to
know
the
part
of
speech
of
a
particular
word
we
use
these
criteria
to
test
a
hypothesis
about
the
word’s
part
of
speech
we
will
ask
you
to
do
similar
activities
in
the
exercises
sometimes
by
gathering
data
sometimes
by
analyzing
material
that
lies
just
a
step

what
is

in

of
these
areas
and
prepares
you
to
read
applied
studies
that
you
will
encounter
in
your

these

can
be
read

on
occasion
you
will
find
some
cross

to

in

along
with
some
phonetic

that
may
send
you
back
to
our
chapter
on

in
many
instances
we
will
mention
a
topic
briefly
discuss
it
and
return
to
it
in
greater
depth
later
our
hope
is
that
this
cycling
will
provide
you
with
an
opportunity
to
get
an
initial
familiarity
with
a
topic
and
then
build
on
that
familiarity
later
these
books
are
far
from
covering
the
wealth
of
information
on
topics
that
you
might
be
interested
in
as
a
teacher
to
survey
all
of
these
would
require
several
more
books

encourage
you
to
consult

hints
for
success
the
study
of
the
english
language
is
demanding
first
you
will
find
yourself
confronting
challenges
to
linguistic
assumptions
and
even
prejudices
that
have
become
ingrained
in
you
through
your
education
and
that
are
widely
accepted
without
critical
examination
by
the
majority
of
educated
english
speakers
second
you
may
find
yourself
in
a
mode
of
analysis
quite
different
from
that
of
your
own
studies
third
you
will
confront
considerable
lin
guistic
detail
and
the
large
number
of
new
terms
required
to
conceptualize
and
describe
it
while
we
cannot
guarantee
that
these
new
ideas
will
be
easy
to
master
although
many
people
do
find
them
so
we
believe
that
they
are
worth
your
effort
and
will
serve
you
well
in
your
career
because
what
you
will
learn
in
these
pages
is
as
much
skill
as
informa
tion
do
not
expect
to
master
this
material
in
a
single
reading
the
best
strategy
for
most
people
is
to
do
a
preliminary
reading
do
the
exercises
and
then
re
read
and
reread
again
research
on
learning
and
remembering
shows

perhaps
obvious—the
more
frequently
and
deeply
you
review
material
the
better
you
will
remember
and
understand
it
if
you
are
a
student
attend
class
and
ask
questions
if
you
are
having
difficulties
the
chances
are
good
that
many
of
your
classmates
are
too
and
will
benefit
from
the
instructor’s
answers
to
your
questions
exercises
are
scattered
throughout
the
book
we
encourage
you
to
tackle
as
many
as
possible
this
need
not
involve
working
them
out
in
full
detail
unless
your
instructor
requires
it
you
might
just
work
out
the
outline
of
a
solution
however
you
cannot
learn
the
analytic
skills
required
to
study
linguistics
or
grammar
without
doing
lots
of
hands-on
work
if
you
have
difficulties
with
a
problem
try
to
identify
them
as
specifically
as
possible
if
you
get
an
incorrect
answer
make
sure
also
to
get
an
explanation
of
the
correct
one
t
ry
to
retrace
the
thinking
that
led
you
to
miss
the
question
sometimes
you
can
learn
more
from
mistakes
than
from
perfection
one
of
our
goals
is
to
help
you
develop
your
skills
in
independent
language
analysis
teachers
are
regularly
called
upon
to
answer
questions
whose
answers
can
not
be
found
in
textbooks
or
reference
works
doing
exercises
is
essential
for
independence
t
erminology
is
plentiful
in
linguistics
just
as
in
every
other
discipline
remember
that
technical
terms
usually
have
specific
meanings
so
you
may
not
be
able
to
substitute
ordinary
words
for
them
we
have
provided
glos
saries
to
help
you
identify
definitions
you
should
consult
them
often
be
particularly
careful
with
terms
e.g
semantics
that
may
have
a
familiar
meaning
in
ordinary
language
but
a
significantly
different
one
in
technical
usage
definitions
should
be
supplemented
with
explanations
elaborations
of
the
minimal
statements
in
the
glossary
remember
though
to
use
precise
language
in
defining
terms
linguists
like
to
think
of
themselves
as
scientists
and
so
value
precision
and
accuracy
explanations
may
be
taken
from
the
text
or
from
class
notes
if
you
are
a
student
t
ry
to
have
a
specific
pro
totypical
example
of
each
term
select
an
example
that
is
clear
to
you
and
is
uncontroversial
and
be
sure
to
understand
just
why
your
example
exempli
fies
the
concept
memorization
has
had
a
bad
press
but
it
is
necessary
more
often
than
we
think
and
not
only
for
exams
we
do
not
encourage
memorization
for
its
own
sake
but
rather
to
make
your
passive
knowledge
more
active
the
best
time
to
memorize
is
after
you
have
become
familiar
with
a
concept
through
exposure
for
long
lists
e.g
the
prepositions
of
english
do
not
try
to
re
member
every
item
select
a
small
number
and
then
only
to
illustrate
a
con
cept
and
use
the
criteria
given
in
the
book
for
deciding
which
other
items
delahunty
and
garvey
18belong
to
the
list
as
you
gain
experience
try
to
add
gradually
to
that
short
list
we
do
not
recommend
that
you
require
your
students
to
learn
lists
of
items
unless
they
are
learning
english
as
a
second
or
foreign
language
and
even
then
only
sparingly
second
opinions
aren’t
just
good
for
your
health
reading
other
authors
on
the
topics
of
these
books
will
greatly
help
you
to
learn
and
remember
what
you
study
we
encourage
you
to
seek
out
other
books
on
these
topics
begin
ning
with
those
we’ve
listed
in
the
references
and
resources
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
at
the
head
of
each
chapter
we
list
the
chapter’s
key
concepts
for
teachers
we
hope
these
will
help
you
find
topics
you
want
to
read
about
for
students
we
imagine
these
topics
serving
as
the
focus
for
essays

is

and

approaches
to
the
study
of
language
the
study
of
language
the
study
of
spoken
and
written
language
occupies
a
significant
part
of
contemporary
primary
and
secondary
school
and
university
curricula
the
grammars
handbooks
of
style
and
composition
texts
used
in
these
cur
ricula
are
based
on
various
assumptions
about
language
and
about
why
it
should
be
studied
it
is
important
that
teachers
have
a
critical
understanding
of
these
assumptions
which
in
many
instances
are
either
indirectly
stated
or
omitted
entirely
these
books
are
designed
to
help
you
to
•
develop
the
critical
resources
you
need
as
a
teacher
to
respond
to
many
language-related
issues
•
understand
the
many
concepts
needed
to
talk
appropriately
and
accurately
about
language
•
develop
skills
that
you
will
use
in
everyday
teaching
of
language
literature
reading
and
writing
in
the
pages
to
follow
you
will
encounter
ideas
about
language
that
may
be
new
to
you
and
which
may
contradict
ideas
you’ve
been
taught
we
cannot
guarantee
that
these
new
concepts
will
be
easy
to
master
but
we
do
believe
that
they
are
worth
your
best
efforts
we
will
as
we
said
earlier
try
to
begin
with
what
you
know
about
language
for
example
you
have
probably
been
taught
to
avoid
non-standard
expressions
such
as
seen
or
seed
instead
of
saw
to
avoid
multiple
nouns
as
modifiers
to
make
sure
that
your
subjects
and
verbs
agree
to
use
parallel
structures
where
possible
and
the
like
these
are
usage
rules
they
have
at
least
two
jobs
to
do
first
they
help
define
the
standard
variety
of
english—recall
our
question
in
our
introductory
chapter
that
asked
you
to
consider
why
anything
e.g
electrical
outlets
might
be
standardized
you
probably
answered
by
saying
that
standardization
allows
the
greatest
number
of
people
to
use
it
for
the
greatest
number
of
purposes
you
might
also
have
added
that
if
something
is
standardized
then
it
can
be
maintained
in
that
form
for
a
long
period
of
time
standardizing
a
language
delahunty
and
garvey
24has
the
same
goals
to
allow
as
many
people
as
possible
to
communicate
ef
fectively
with
each
other
and
to
allow
people
at
any
time
to
read
texts
that
were
written
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
before
they
were
born
much
as
we
read
the
novels
of
jane
austen
now
and
standardization
allows
us
to
write
texts
that
will
be
understood
by
many
generations
to
come
the
usage
rules
help
ensure
that
standard
english
is
used
in
formal
writ
ing
and
speaking
so
as
to
make
our
writings
and
speeches
clear
efficient
and
effective
given
our
purposes
in
communicating
and
the
characteristics
of
our
audiences
rules
that
tell
us
which
forms
to
choose
saw
not
seen
or
seed
as
past
tense
of
see
or
what
syntactic
patterns
to
avoid
multiple
noun
modifiers
or
to
use
parallel
structures
are
prescriptive
ideally
they
prescribe
what
are
taken
to
be
the
most
generally
used
formal
writing
and
speaking
practices
at
a
particular
time
usage
rules
are
extremely
important
speakers
and
writers
who
violate
them
are
likely
to
be
judged
harshly
it
is
a
major
part
of
any
teacher’s
job
to
ensure
that
students
can
write
in
accordance
with
these
rules
they
can
be
found
in
composition
textbooks
which
often
devote
entire
sections
to
them
they
can
also
be
found
in
writers’
handbooks
of
usage
rules
in
usage
dictionar
ies
or
in
selected
entries
in
desk
dictionaries
unfortunately
these
handbooks
do
not
always
agree
with
each
other
and
do
not
always
keep
up
with
the
ac
cepted
writing
practices
in
important
genres
moreover
the
conventions
differ
from
one
discipline
to
another
however
for
teachers
to
be
able
to
teach
the
usage
rules
they
must
un
derstand
the
concepts
that
underlie
them
and
the
terminology
in
which
they
are
expressed
for
example
they
must
know
what
nouns
are
be
able
to
recognize
them
in
texts
and
to
produce
examples
of
them
on
demand
what
past
tense
means
and
how
it
is
formed
what
agreement
means
and
how
it
is
expressed
which
structures
are
parallel
and
which
are
not
and
what
participles
are
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
recognize
them
when
they
dangle
or
to
teach
them
in
order
to
expand
the
range
of
structures
their
students
can
use
in
their
writing
and
they
must
be
aware
of
current
usage
controversies
you
may
know
about
some
of
these
things
for
example
you
may
know
about
the
traditional
parts
of
speech
about
subjects
and
predicates
about
direct
and
indirect
objects
in
this
book
we
will
develop
all
these
and
re
lated
ideas
by
making
use
of
the
findings
of
modern
linguistic
and
discourse
studies
our
point
of
view
will
be
descriptive
rather
than
prescriptive
that
is
rather
than
prescribing
how
someone
thinks
the
language
should
be
we
will
attempt
to
describe
as
objectively
as
we
can
as
much
of
modern
stan
dard
english
as
space
allows
our
descriptive
stance
is
that
of

in
25
conceptions
of
language
and
grammargeneral
which
tends
to
think
of
itself
as
scientific
we
include
a
chapter
on
usage
in
book
ii
exercise
many
people
think
of
dictionaries
as
the
final
arbiters
of
usage
issues
particularly
regarding
words
read
the
front
matter
i.e
all
the
text
before
the
list
of
words
of
your
dictionary
and
find
out
how
its
editors
view
usage
issues
then
look
up
some
words
whose
usage
is
controver
sial
such
as
hopefully
as
a
sentence
adverb
e.g
hopefully
a
solution
will
be
found
for
the
problems
in
the
middle
east
unique
as
a
gradable
adjective
e.g
his
writing
style
is
very
unique
demagogue
as
a
verb
e.g
he
demagogued
his
way
into
the
white
house
and
lifestyle
to
mean
culture
e.g
the
san
people
of
southwest
africa
enjoy
a
hunt
er/gatherer
lifestyle
how
does
your
dictionary
treat
these
controver
sies
is
the
treatment
consistent
with
the
editors’
front
matter
claims
when
was
your
dictionary
published
do
you
think
that
the
publication
date
might
have
an
effect
on
these
controversies
our

explores
these
issues
in
more
detail
note
for
a

story
about
the
oed

might
read

the
roles
of
the
english
teacher
standard
english
we
recognize
that
teachers
are
caught
between
apparently
irreconcilable
forces
they
must
ensure
that
their
students
master
the
forms
of
english
that
are
regarded
as
acceptable
correct
educated
and
expected
in
formal
communication
i.e
as
standard
however
educational
linguistic
research
demonstrates
that
students
will
not
learn
the
conventions
of
standard
eng
lish
unless
teachers
respect
their
native
ethnic
regional
and
social
varieties
so
how
might
this
impasse
be
resolved
first
we
must
know
what
is
and
what
is
not
currently
acceptable
sec
ond
we
must
have
a
framework
of
concepts
and
terminology
that
will
allow
us
to
understand
and
teach
about
language
third
we
should
adopt
the
be
delahunty
and
garvey
26lief
that
our
only
legitimate
role
is
to
add
control
of
standard
english
to
our
students’
linguistic
repertoire
not
to
eliminate
our
students’
native
varieties
on
such
unsupportable
grounds
as
that
they
indicate
laziness
or
stupidity
they
don’t
these
books
are
designed
to
help
teachers
fulfill
these
roles
in
addition
teachers
should
make
use
of
their
students’
natural
language
learning
abilities
and
what
is
known
from
fields
such
as
linguistics
and
applied
linguistics
about
teaching
language
for
example
rather
than
overwhelming
students
by
red-lining
every
error
teachers
should
select
those
errors
which
seem
amenable
to
correction
at
the
time
and
bring
the
students’
attention
to
the
similarities
and
differences
between
their
own
practices
and
the
target
ones
they
should
then
focus
on
the
target
until
it
is
well
controlled

linguistic

all

that
is
there
is
no

all
speak

groups

may
speak

and
still
be
speaking
the
same
language
that
is

may
exhibit
dialect
variation
a
simple
demonstration
of
this
is
to
conduct
an
informal
survey
about
the
words
people
use
for
soft
drinks
such
as
soda
pop
and
the
like
and
then
identify
where
in
the
country
the
various
expressions
are
used
languages
vary
by
nation
region
ethnicity
gender
age
and
almost
every
other
grouping
of
people
that
one
can
imagine
languages
also
vary
according
to
their
uses
an
individual
speaker
will
vary
his
or
her
style
of
speech
according
to
contextual
factors
such
as
the
formality
of
the
occasion
for
example
on
relatively
informal
occasions
we
are
likely
to
use
abbreviations
such
as
can’t
and
should’ve
in

is
such
an
important
component
not
just
of

but
of
an
individual’s
personal

and

teachers
must
tread
a
fine
line
between
their

to
teach
the
standard
variety
required
for
social
mobility
and
respecting
students’
native
varieties
as
manifestations
of

just
as
every

has
a
right
to
expect

to

their

and
creed
so
every
child
has
the
right
to
expect
teachers
to
respect
their
language
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
accept
linguistic
variation
if
we
understand
it
and
understand
our
own
attitudes
toward
it
we
deal
with
this
issue
in
more
depth
in
our
chapters
on
variation
and
usage
in
book
ii
in
the
rest
of
this
chapter
we
will
consider
some
of
the
basic
ideas
about
language
that
inform
this
book
what
is
a
language
as
teachers
of
language
which
we
are
whether
we
teach
linguistics
litera
ture
esl
or
physics
we
need
to
have
a
clear
notion
of
what
it
is
that
we
teach
surprisingly
few
people
have
even
the
most
rudimentary
conception
of
what
a
language
is
even
though
they
use
at
least
one
in
nearly
every
waking
moment
of
their
lives
generally
we
can
lead
perfectly
adequate
lives
without
conceptions
based
on
serious
reflection
on
important
topics
for
instance
we
do
not
need
a
precise
understanding
of
physical
notions
such
delahunty
and
garvey
28as
force
work
or
energy
to
hit
home
runs
or
drive
cars
but
education
aims
to
help
us
understand
things
that
we
take
for
granted
language
is
a
prime
example
it
is
a
device
of
mind-boggling
complexity
but
few
people
have
a
clear
conception
of
its
nature
and
use
so
what
is
a
language
what
we
have
in
mind
here
is
a
natural
i.e
not
an
artificial
or
computer-based
system
for
human
communication
such
as
english
chinese
swahili
or
american
sign
language
asl
in
this
book
we’ll
assume
that
a
language
is
a
set
of
rules
unconsciously
present
in
the
mind
which
enables
human
beings
to
represent
and
communicate
meanings
by
producing
audible
visible
or
tactile
symbols
that
these
rules
system
atically
relate
to
those
meanings
this
definition
may
seem
forbidding
and
abstract
so
let’s
look
at
it
piece
by
piece
a
language
enables
its
users
to
communicate
meanings
by
systematically
relating
perceptible
actions
and
meanings
meanings
are
mental
states
or
activities
and
as
such
cannot
be
directly
ob
served
if
we
want
to
communicate
our
meanings
to
someone
else
we
must
use
something
they
can
perceive
with
their
senses—for
example
noises
gestures
flag
waving
or
marks
on
paper
for
any
of
these
to
communicate
successfully
there
must
be
a
system
that
consistently
relates
the
observable
signals
with
the
private
meanings
for
lots
of
good
reasons
sound
evolved
as
the
primary
mode
of
human
communication
this
issue
is
discussed
in
the
next
section
most
people
conceive
of
meaning
in
terms
of
information
ideas
about
the
external
world
or
about
our
thoughts
and
beliefs
this
is
called
referential
experiential
ideational
meaning
referential
meanings
rep
resent
events
such
as
the
us
women’s
soccer
team
won
the
world
cup
or
states
such
as
the
sun
is
a
small
star
they
are
descriptions
of
states
of
affairs
real
or
imagined
referential
meaning
is
probably
the
most
com
monly
communicated
type
of
meaning
however
there
are
other
kinds
•
expressive
meaning
reflects
the
emotional
state
of
a
speaker
ouch
has
no
referential
status
but
expresses
pain
•
persuasive
conative
meaning
refers
to
the
intended
effect
of
an
utterance
on
its
hearer
it
attempts
to
get
an
audience
to
per
form
an
action
or
to
believe
something
get
out
is
an
attempt
to
get

to
leave
i

you
honest
i

is
an
attempt
to
get
someone
to
believe
that

them
•
social
phatic
interpersonal
meaning
as
in
expressions
such
as
hi
and
how
are
you
establishes
and
maintains
social
contact
be
tween
communicators
•
t
extual
meaning
is
communicated
by
utterances
that
constitute
part
of
a
text
e.g
the
dogs
were
very
noisy
the
german
shep
herds
were
the
worst
without
very
noisy
in
the
first
of
these
two
sentences
it
would
be
impossible
to
interpret
the
worst
as
noisiest
this
meaning
derives
from
the
assumption
that
the
two
sentences
are
to
be
interpreted
as
a
text
that
is
one
or
more
sentences
or
utterances
intended
to
be
taken
as
a
coherent
whole
some
expres
sions
have
only
textual
meanings
for
example
in
some
of
its
uses
so
indicates
that
the
expression
it
introduces
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
conclusion
drawn
from
a
prior
expression
or
from
the
context
the
retort
so
what
is
a
demand
to
know
what
conclusion
to
draw
from
what
a
speaker
has
just
said
•
metalinguistic
meaning
addresses
matters
concerning
the
lan
guage
itself
definitions
and
word
puzzles
are

in
fact
they
tend
to
assume
that
the
spoken
language
should
be
modeled
on
its
written
form
for
example
many
people
will
use
a
word’s
spelling
to
resolve
a
dispute
over
its
pronunciation
and
the
pronun
ciation
of
some
words
has
changed
to
be
more
consistent
with
their
spell
ings

many
people
nowadays
think
that

be
pronounced
with
a
t
sound
linguists
in
general
believe
that
sound
is
the
primary
medium
of
lan
guage
because
it
precedes
writing
in
evolutionary
and
individual
develop
ment
because
letters
represent
sounds
not
vice
versa
and
because
we
use
spoken
language
more
frequently
in
our
lives
so
it
is
arguably
more
im
portant
to
us
to
support
their
claim
linguists
point
out
facts
such
as
the
following
•
children
learn
to
talk
before
they
learn
to
read
and
write
•
children
learn
to
talk
naturally
that
is
without
being
expressly
taught
reading
and
writing
must
be
taught
•
there
are
many
languages
that
have
no
writing
systems

32the
relation
between
meaning
and
sound
is
conventional
and
arbitrary
according
to
ferdinand
de
saussure
1983
1916
and
accepted
by
the
vast
majority
of
linguists
the
relation
between
a
word’s
sound
and
its
meaning
is
conventional
that
is
the
speakers
of
a
language
tacitly
agree
on
which
mean
ings
to
associate
with
which
sounds
for
example
the
fruit
we
make
apple
jelly
from
is
called
apple
in
english
pomme
in
french
manzana
in
spanish
úll
in
irish
and
other
names
in
other
languages
this
conventional
relationship
is
arbitrary
that
is
speakers
of
a
language
as
a
group
are
free
to
associate
any
sounds
with
any
meaning
it
doesn’t
mat
ter
which
sounds
they
associate
with
which
meanings
thus
the
sound
of
the
word
i
is
arbitrarily
though
not
randomly
i.e
without
purpose
chosen
by
english
speakers
to
represent
the
speaker
of
an
utterance
we
could
equally
designate
the
speaker
by
the
sounds
je
as
in
french
or
yo
as
in
spanish
or
ich
as
in
german
or
wo
as
in
chinese
or
any
other
sound(s
we
agreed
on
from
the
claim
that
sound
meaning
relationships
are
both
conventional
and
arbitrary
it
follows
that
there
need
not
be
any
similarity
between
sound
and
what
it
refers
to
the
word
pigeon
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
birds
it
refers
to
similarly
the
words
yell
and
whisper
can
be
said
either
loudly
or
softly
even
though
they
refer
to
loud
and
soft
sounds
giant
and
dwarf
have
the
same
number
of
sounds
despite
the
different
sizes
of
the
things
they
refer
to
lilliputian
is
a
big
word
meaning
small
but
big
is
a
small
word
meaning
large
finally
there
is
no
natural
or
causal
connection
between
words
and
their
meanings
that
is
words
and
their
meanings
are
not
connected
in
the
way
that
smoke
and
fire
or
explosions
and
noise
or
cars
and
air
pollution
are
we
know
that
fires
cause
smoke
and
so
when
we
see
smoke
we
can
assume
that
there
is
also
fire
the
particular
sounds
of
a
word
do
not
cause
its
meanings
in
this
way
nor
do
the
meanings
cause
the
choice
of
word
sounds
however
all
languages
have
some
expressions
that
are
non
arbitrary
they
are
said
to
be
motivated
by
some
factor
other
than
convention
one
mo
tivation
is
similarity
between
the
word
sounds
and
sounds
associated
with
the
things
the
words
refer
to
common
examples
of
these
are
onomatopoeic
words
for
animal
noises
e.g
moo
bow-wow
and
quack-quack
note
that
the
last
two
of
these
suggest
that
dogs
and
ducks
normally
make
noises
in
pairs
and
that
english
speakers
can
distinguish
a
dog’s
bow
from
its
wow
note
however
that
an
irish
dog
goes
amh-amh
and
a
serbo-croatian
one
goes
av
av
this
suggests
that
onomatopoeic
words
are
not
perfect
imitations
at
least
some
conventionality
is
at
work
in
them
to
appreciate
the
range
of
ways
in
which
languages
represent
animal
sounds

another
type
of
motivation
is
sound
symbolism
the
relatively
consistent
association
of
certain
sounds
with
certain
meanings
for
example
the
ee
vowel
sounds
of
teeny
suggests
something
small
we
find
similar
uses
of
similar
vowels
in

spanish
for
example
uses
the
suffix
ito/a
to
desig
nate
small
things
and
children
however
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
vowel
always
carries
this
diminutive
meaning
for
example
no
hint
of
smallness
appears
in
words
like
beefy

keep
or
heal
and
similarities
with
other

may
be
purely

related
to
english
than
spanish
is
while
it
is
true
that
the
vast
majority
of
words
that
consist
of
just
a
single
meaningful
part
e.g
lamp
and
post
are
arbitrarily
related
to
their
meanings
combinations
of
such
words
frequently
are
not
that
lamppost
means
lamp
post
is

by
the
fact
that
it
consists
of
lamp

duality
of

this
strange
phrase
means
that
meaningful
linguistic
units
such
as
words
are
composed
of
discrete
units
that
have
no
meaning
for
example
the
word
book
clearly
has
a
meaning
but
just
as
clearly
each
of
its
individual
sounds
b
oo
and
k
has
no
meaning
individual
sounds
like
these
can
be
used
to
create
other
words
so
languages
take
one
or
a
combination
of
meaning
less
sounds
and
then
assign
meanings
to
them
the
expressions
of
non
human
animals
even
those
with
relatively
large
numbers
of
expressions
seem
not
to
be

the

human
language
allows
human
beings
to
talk
about
anything
regardless
of
whether
what
they
talk
about
is

at
which
it
occurs
as
a
result
we
are
far
better
liars
than
other
animals
a
language
is
distinctively
human
this
is
a
remarkably
controversial
topic
when
we
speak
of
language
in
this
book
what
we
have
in
mind
are
systems
such
as
english
french
swahili
or
navajo
however
the
word
language
is
often
used
loosely
to
indicate
any
means
of
conveying
meaning—e.g
the
language
of
dance
the
language
of
flowers
animal
languages
the
discipline
of
semiotics
developed
to
study
the
language-like
characteristics
of
various
forms
of
communication
the
range
of
semiotic
meaningful
systems
is
great
encompassing
natural
languages
ges
tures
spatial
relations
animal
communication
film
advertising
logos
traffic
signals
clothing
and
many
other
modes
of
communication
much
semiotic
research
draws
on
linguistic
concepts
semiotic
and
other
linguistic
studies
have
demonstrated
the
richness
of
human
communication
but
have
never
uncovered
any
means
of
communi
cation
superior
to
human
language
in
the
complexity
range
or
precision
of
its
meanings
this
is
not
surprising
one
could
hardly
imagine
translating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
into
body
language
or
the
language
of
cloth
ing
while
semiotics
has
dramatically
enlarged
our
awareness
of
the
scope
of
meaningful
systems
it
has
produced
no
challengers
to
language
either
on
quantitative
or
qualitative
grounds
likewise
research
into
animal
communication
has
vastly
improved
our
ap
preciation
of
the
natural
communication
systems
of
primates
dolphins
birds
and
frogs
but
it
has
presented
no
rivals
to
human
communication
again
ei
ther
on
qualitative
or
quantitative
grounds
a
few
primates
have
learned
usu
ally
with
intensive
training
to
communicate
in
language-like
ways
through
manual
signs
plastic
symbols
or
computers
their
success
tells
us
a
good
deal
about
their
intelligence
especially
of
bonobo
chimps
but
their
communica
tive
systems
are
not
equivalent
to
english
or
any
other
human
language
for
some
people
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
humans
have
language
and
animals
don’t
according
to
many
religions
language
was
given
to
humans
by
a
god
for
others
this
topic
is
intensely
controversial
some
claim
that
our
closest
animal
relatives
share
some
of
our
linguistic
capacities
others
insist
that
there
is
no
continuity
between
whatever
cognition
and
communication
other
primates
are
capable
of
and

we
must
add
here
that
all
normal
human
beings
can
be
both
producers
and
receivers
of
human
language
a
characteristic
known
as
reciprocity
or
interchangeability
in
many
animal

systems
one

the

another
perspective
on
this
issue
is
the
relationship
between
intelligence
and
language
assuming
controversially
that
iq
provides
a
reliable
index
of
intelligence

that

abilities
are
not

is

all

all

is
the

with

that

so
learning
a

depends
upon
having
both
the

bases
and
the

environment
knowledge
of
a

is

in
the

knowing

then

no

the
clearest
sign
of
unconscious
knowledge
is
the
presence
of
linguistic
intuitions
gut
feelings
about

that
we
could
not

without
un

these
intuitions
are

they
derive
from

specific
to

and
from

one’s
unconscious
knowledge
of
language
is
called
linguistic
competence
we
will
have
more
to
say
about
linguistic
competence
below
a
language
consists
of
rules
unfortunately
the
word
rule
conjures
up
exactly
the
wrong
image
of
lin
guistic
knowledge
suggesting
the
prescriptions
of
right
and
wrong
that
we
find
in
handbooks
linguists
however
use
the
word
to
mean
two
related
ideas
first
a
rule
is
a
part
of
our
unconscious
knowledge
of
our
language
our
linguistic
competence
it
is
a
mental
pattern
about
a
limited
part
of
a
language
e.g
pronunciation
sentence
structure
or
what
a
word
means
for
instance

when
we
produce
sentences
of
this
sort
we
are
acting
as
if
we
were
following
a
rule
that
says
put
subjects
before
verbs
and
verbs
before
objects
if
we
were
not
following
rules
our
speech
would
be
chaotic
and
unintelligible
not
the
highly
patterned
communicative
activity
it
is
second
linguists
also
use
the
word
rule
to
refer
to
their
attempts
to
for
mulate
these
linguistic
patterns
in
words
that
is
to
the
model
we
build
of
an
unconscious
mental
rule
our
model
is
not
the
rule
itself
which
remains

can
you

in
which

a
language
is
a
system
rules
are
not
distributed
randomly
in
the
mind
like
potatoes
in
a
sack
rather
they
are
systematically
related
to
one
another
it
is
easiest
to
envision
this
con
ception
with
an
analogy
a
computer
system
has
a
set
of
components
central
processing
unit
monitor
keyboard
speakers

types
whose

interact
in
precise
though
limited
ways
with
each

and
with
parts
of
other

systems
likewise
have
components
the
most
commonly
cited
ones
are
•
phonetics
phonology
•
morphology
•
vocabulary
•

•

with
the

patterns
in
texts
of
various
kinds
as
we
proceed
you
will
learn
the
intricate
ways
in
which
the
system
operates
for
the
moment
let
us
look
at
one
concrete
example
of
how
the
system
creates
interdependencies
among
its
rules
and
components
the
syntactic
rule
for
yes/no
questions
is
connected
to
the
rules
of
pronunciation
specifically
the
rules
for
intonation
the
musical
pattern
of
speech
listen
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
your
voice
as
you
say
3a
as
a
statement
of
fact
and
3b
as
a
question
3
a
they’re
leaving
at
6:00
b
they’re
leaving
at

the
order
of
words
stays
the
same
but
the
intonation
pattern
indicates
whether
the
sentence
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
statement
or
as
a
question
in
this
book
we
will
begin
our
discussion
with
a
skeletal
overview
of
english
grammar
beginning
with
the
largest
grammatical
units
sentences
and
working
down
to
the
smallest
sounds
and
letters
this
is
the
opposite
of
our
presentation
of
the
grammar
in
the
following
chapters
there
we
be
gin
with
the
smallest
units
and
work
our
way
up
to
the
largest
we
hope
that
by
spiraling
in
this
way
readers
who
have
no
background
in
language
study
will
get
an
initial
orientation
and
those
who
have
had
some
background
will
get
a
quick
refresher
before
venturing
into
greater
depth
competence
and
performance
as
we
mentioned
modern
linguists
distinguish
between
the
knowledge
that
speakers
of
a
language
must
have
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
that
language
and
the
actual
use
they
make
of
that
knowledge
to
speak
understand
read
or
write
linguists
call
our
unconscious
knowledge
of
the
rules
that
constitute
the
language
competence
and
our
linguistic
activities
that
make
use
of
that
knowledge
performance
performance
provides
ample
evidence
of
competence
we
can
use
our
abil
ity
to
specify
what
is
and
what
is
not
grammatical
i.e
consistent
with
the
unconscious
rules
of
our
language
consider
the
following

arrested
39
conceptions
of
language
and
grammarthough
we
can
certainly
make
sense
of
the
sentence
we
know
that
it
isn’t
natural
english
the
german
translation
would
be
grammatical
with
this
word
order
of
course
we
may
not
be
able
to
articulate
exactly
what
makes
the
sentence
unnatural
nor
is
it
likely
that
we
have
been
taught
anything
ex
plicitly
about
sentences
like
this
likewise
you
can
determine
hidden
grammatical
relations
that
is
im
plicit
subjects

and
the

joan

joan
such
understood
relations
are
very
common
in
language
finally
you
can
also
perceive

you

about

you
might
mull
over

refusal
to
mourn
the
death
by

of
a
child
in
london
after
the
first
death
there
is
no
other
the
idea
of
competence
depends
on
certain
idealizations
many
linguists
though
by
no
means
all
assume
that
all
speakers
of
a
language
have
the
same
set
of
rules
in
their
competence
this
is
a
deliberate
simplification
made
with
full
awareness
of
the
variety
inherent
in
natural
language
it
is
done
to
allow
linguists
to
develop
models
of
competence
without
being
distracted
by
phenomena
that
do
not
appear
to
affect
the
model’s
basic
principles
this
assumption
is
not
uncontroversial
it
has
been
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
ignore
the
social
discourse
and
textual
functions
of
language
which
some
linguists
believe
to
be
crucial
in
understanding
language
structure
it
delahunty
and
garvey
40has
also
been
viewed
because
the
majority
of
linguists
are
white
male
and
middle
class
as
a
thinly
disguised
attempt
to
define
their
variety
of
english
as
the
basis
for
the
grammatical
theory
for
all
languages
and
all
varieties
much
as
latin
grammar
was
until
recently
and
in
many
situations
still
is
the
model
for
the
grammars
of
many
european
languages
while
neither
criticism
is
justified
in
its
extreme
version
both
point
to
limitations
of
the
language-as
competence
approach
they
also
point
to
the
need
to
understand
language
as
a
social
artifact
used
by
social
beings
in
social
contexts
for
social
purposes
we
deal
with
such
considerations
in
our
chapters
on
variation
and
usage
in
book
ii
a
language
is
acquired
because
many
modern
theoretical
linguists
begin
from
the
assumption
that
what
they
are
modeling
is
knowledge
it
follows
that
their
theories
have
implications
for
psychology
and
ultimately
for
biology
many
believe
that
language
is
a
very
specialized
perhaps
unique
kind
of
knowledge
they
believe
that
an
individual’s
primary
form
of
language
is
not
acquired
in
the
ways
that
other
kinds
of
knowledge
are
acquired
such
as
writing
or
arithme
tic
in
support
of
this
belief
they
point
out
that
children
learn
the
language
or
languages
of
their
environments
without
any
instruction
or
correction
from
parents
or

it

only

from

struc
tures

the
linguists
who
are
persuaded
by
arguments
like
these
hold
that
human
beings
do
not
enter
the
world
as
blank
slates
rather
they
bring
with
them
innate
ideas
that
guide
them
in
acquiring
their
language(s
on
the
basis
of
these
observations
and
the
similarities
between

many
linguists
argue
that
human
beings
are
genetically
endowed
with
a
capac
ity
to
acquire
languages
with
particular
kinds
of
rule
systems
they
argue
that
linguistic
knowledge
is
of
a
different
type
than
other
knowledge
because
it
is
based
on
specialized
cognitive
structures
which
in
turn
appear
to
be
based
on
specialized
brain
structures
in
support
of
this
neurobiological
claim
linguists
point
out
that
first
lan
guage
learning
must
be
accomplished
within
a
critical
period
in
a
person’s
life
before
the
teenage
years
if
it
is
to
be
successful
moreover
damage
to
cer
tain
parts
of
the
brain
mainly
in
the
left
hemisphere
affects
people’s
linguistic
abilities
whereas
damage
to
corresponding
areas
in
the
right
hemisphere

thus
the
language
capacity
appears
to
be
at
least
partially
localized
in

side
of

brain
if
this
point
of
view
is
correct
it
explains
why
even
with
intense
and
specific

no
non-humans
even
the
most

ever
learned

about

of

it
used

be

42that
all
knowledge
whether
acquired
by
a
human
or
a
bird
was
essentially
a
matter
of
habit
one
learned
to
respond
in
specific
ways
to
particular
events
and
the
strength
of
the
habit
was
a
function
of
the
number
of
times
a
particu
lar
stimulus
and
response
were
associated
by
the
learner
from
this
point
of
view
understanding
a
sentence
would
be
a
matter
of
associating
a
particular
response
with
it
and
learning
a
language
would
be
a
matter
of
learning
just
which
responses
go
with
which
sentences
the
process
was
viewed
by
behav
iorist
psychologists
as
in

out
that
the

approach
to

cannot
in

account
for

or
its

this
is
because
language
is
vast
in
fact
the
number
of
sentences
in
any
language
is
infinite
so
no
theory
that
assumes
that
language
learning
is

can
in

explain
it

this

of

it
is
because

are
recursive
that
they

all

this

it

descriptive
linguists

what
they
say
and
how
they
say
it—regardless

they
do
not

it

consistently
speaks

in
such
and
such
a
way
then
so
be
it

for
the
descriptive

is
correct

view

how

do
you
think
the

are

a

c
whom
did
you
speak

are

to
use
whom
in
sentences
like
8c
and
far
more
likely
to
use
who
d
who
did

speak

descriptive

comparing
8c

would
note

that
the

its
left

not
in

sections

sketch
the
spectrum
of
interests
that
descriptive
linguists
have
pursued
in
so
doing
we
hope
to
stimulate
your
curiosity
about
topics
that
will
one
day
inform
your
own
teaching
theoretical
linguistics
theoretical
linguists
take
a
descriptive
attitude
but
they
want
to
go
beyond
merely
describing
language
their
goals
are
to
understand
what
they
observe
and
to
explain
why
human
languages
are
as
they
are
to
do
this
they
construct
models
or
theories
of
language
models
are
portrayals
verbal
and
visual
of
the
design
of
languages
for
instance
a
model
might
sketch
out
a
syntactic
component
that
includes
several
different
types
of
rules
as
we’ll
see
in
our
chapter
on
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
in
so
doing
theoretical
linguists
try
to
formulate
general
statements
about
what
is
possible
and
what
is
not
possible
in
the
syntax
of
human
languages
for
example
a
theoretical
linguist
might
try
to
determine
why
no
human
language
asks
questions
by
simply
reversing
the
word
order
of
statements
theoretical
linguists
thus
can
identify
some
very
general
principles
that
govern
language
in
science
as
in
many
other
fields
if
a
statement
follows
log
ically
from
general
principles
then
it
is
regarded
as
explained
in
linguistics
if
the
rules
proposed
for
a
language
follow
logically
from
general
assumptions
about
the
nature
of
human
language
they
are
regarded
as
explanations
and
the
general
hypotheses
are
supported
theoretical
linguists
tend
to
think
of
themselves
as
scientists
and
of
their
activities
as
following
the
methodologies
of
science
they
observe
phenom
ena
make
general
statements
to
describe
their
observations
hypothesize
what
else
should
be
true
if
their
generalizations
are
true
and
test
whether
they
were
correct
if
they
are
correct
they
create
more
hypotheses
and
test
again
if
they
are
incorrect
they
revise
their
generalizations
and
hypotheses
and
test
again
in
a
sense
they
want
to
be
wrong
when
they
find
where
they
are
wrong
they
can
improve
their
original
formulation
and
account
for
a
wider
range
of
data

linguistic
study
from
this
point
of
view
is
not
a
hunt
for
errors
but
rather
a
dynamic
ongoing
creative
task
subject
to
constant
criticism
and
revision
it
is
important
to
understand
this
because
not
to
do
so
leads
to
several
misconceptions
language
rules
from
this
perspective
are
not
a
body
of
immutable
laws
or
conventions
discovered
or
imposed
by
scholars
they
are
reflections
of
our
current
understanding
of
the
phenomena
of
natural
language
it
is
also
important
not
to
see
this
as
an
endorsement
of
the
view
that
anything
goes
in
english
these
days
in
the
last
two
centuries
linguists
have
discovered
an
enormous
amount
about
many
individual
languages
and
much
about
natural
language
in
general
consequently
particularly
since
the
late
1950s
new
understandings
about
the
nature
of
human
beings
and
the
hu
man
mind
have
emerged
these
have
provided
far
richer
models
of
how
hu
man
beings
learn
remember
and
solve
problems
than
were
available
before
furthermore
we
have
discovered
a
great
deal
about
the
relationships
between
language
culture
and
society
it
turns
out
that
we
and
other
creatures
are
far
more
complex
than
we
had

ourselves

you

the

might

that

some

others

the

against
the

that
constitute

and
the
rules
of
appropriateness
of

to
specific

if
the

cannot
assign
a

to
the

then
it
will
be
either
completely

meaningless
if
the

there
are

underpinnings
to

for

curricula
rang
ing
from
phonics
to
whole
language
in
spite
of
its
many
contributions
linguistics
has
not
had
its
full
impact
on
education
perhaps
teachers
fear
the
technicalities
of
a
discipline
that
claims
english
study
to
be
a
science
some
may
see
linguistics
as
a
threat
to
tradi
tional
values
in
teaching
the
reason
may
be
that
mainstream
linguistics
is
an
independent
discipline
with
its
own
objectives
and
methods
and
which
has
not
embraced
the
poststructuralist
and
postmodernist
approaches
adopted
in
literature
and
composition
studies
this
is
an
ironic
turn
because
the
roots
of
all
of
these
approaches
lie
in
early
twentieth
century
linguistics
in
spite
of
this
divergence
of
interests
we
are
convinced
that
teachers
are
best
served
by
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
language
and
the
ways
it
is
approached
by
linguists
one
of
the
aims
of
this
book
is
to
initiate
you
into
the
linguistic
point
of
view
and
to
provide
you
with
the
linguistic
literacy
that
you
will
need
in
the
contemporary
classroom
as
we
have
tried
to
show
in
this
section
applied
work
grows
out
of
theoretical
and
analytical
frameworks
moreover
theoreti
cal
and
analytic
notions
can
provide
us
and
our
students
with
intellectually
stimulating
and
rewarding
classroom
activities
many
of
the
exercises
in

introduction
this
chapter
has
a
number
of
purposes
first
it
aims
to
place
the
study
of
grammar
within
the
larger
study
of
discourse
and
text
second
it
aims
to
provide
a
review
of
traditional
grammatical
concepts
and
terminol
ogy
for
those
who
have
studied
grammar
before
if
you
have
not
studied
grammar
before
it
will
give
a
very
simple
introduction
to
grammatical
ideas
and
plenty
of
practice
in
using
those
ideas
in
straightforward
exer
cises
third
it
provides
a
basis
for
the
deeper
and
more
critical
study
of
language
that
we
present
in
the
remainder
of
this
book
and
in
book
ii
in
this
chapter
we
only
provide
examples
of
concepts
we
do
not
justify
those
concepts
or
their
application
though
we
will
sketch
how
to
justify
analyses
in
our
section
on
form
function
and
meaning
our
goal
is
to
help
you
get
up
to
speed
in
recognizing
basic
grammatical
elements
because
the
presentation
in
the
following
chapters
progresses
from
the
smallest
units
sounds
and
works
upward
to
the
largest
sentences
we
begin
this
chapter
with
the
largest
units
clauses
and
sentences
and
work
downward
to
the
smallest
we
use
language
to
communicate
with
each
other
this
communica
tion
may
occur
in
conversation
which
can
be
either
directly
face-to
face
or
mediated
by
some
technology
such
as
the
telephone
we
may
also
com
municate
by
writing
to
each
other
communication
in
which
language
is
used
is
called
discourse
and
the
products
of
discourse
are
called
texts
which
can
be
recordings
of
spoken
communication
or
the
writings
that
constitute
a
written
discourse
discourse
is
coherent
cohesive
contex
tualized
and
purposeful
communicative
activity
we
will
have
more
to
delahunty

58say
about
discourse
and
texts
in
our
chapter
on
discourse
the
texts
that
realize
a
discourse
are
composed
of
various
kinds
of
linguistic
units
the
most
important
of
which
is
the
sentence
the
sentence
is
the
largest
unit
to
which
the
grammatical
rules
of
a
language
apply
sentences
are
com
posed
of
one
or
more
clauses
a
clause
is
composed
of
at
least
two
phrases
one
of
which
plays
the
role
of
subject
the
other
of
predicate
phrases
are
composed
of
one
or
more
words
functioning
as
a
single
grammatical
unit
words
are
composed
of
morphemes
morphemes
are
meaningful
sequences
of
phonemes
units
of
sound
phonemes
are
the
units
of
sound
that
distinguish
words
or
morphemes
from
each
other
they
are
repre
sented
more
or
less
adequately
by
letters
of
the
alphabet
clauses
because
sentences
are
composed
of
one
or
more
clauses
we
begin
with
a
discussion
of
the
latter
clauses
represent
simple
states
of
affairs
these
may
be
states
or
events
states
are
unchanging
situations
events
are
situations
in
which
something
changes
the
simplest
type
of
complete
clause
must
have
two
phrases
one
func
tioning
as
the
subject
and
the
other
as
the
predicate
in
the
following
ex
amples
the
subject
is
italicized
and
the
predicate
is
bolded
note
that
both
subject
and
predicate
can
consist
of
one
or
more
words

a
very
simple
question
what
is
the
typical
order
of
subject
and
predicate
in
english
clauses
besides
occurring
before
the
predicate
subjects
are
often
defined
as
the
phrase
that
represents
something
about
which
something
is
said
by
the
predicate
or
about
which
the
predicate
answers
a
question
for
instance
we
can
view
the
subjects
italicized
in
the
following
clauses
as
representing
something
about
which
the
predicates
bolded
say
something
or
answer
a
question
about
the

are
traditionally
viewed
as
the
expression
denoting
the
receiver
of
or
the
entity
directly
affected
by
the
situation
represented
by
the

thus
if
the

again
note
that

is
denoted
by
the
direct
object
or
the
benefi
ciary
of
whatever
situation
is
denoted

clause
types
at
this
point
we
will
distinguish
seven
types
of
clauses
we
begin
with
the
voice
distinction
between
active
and
passive
versions
of
sentences
sentence
a
is
active
and
b
is
its
passive
version
a
richard
dawkins
wrote
a
devil’s
chaplain
delahunty
and
garvey
66
b
a
devil’s
chaplain
was
written
by
richard
dawkins
note
that
the
passive
version
has
a
form
of
be
was
as
an
auxiliary
verb
and
a
phrase
beginning
with
by
note
also
that
the
subject
of
the
passive
a
devil’s
chaplain
corresponds
to
the
object
of
the
active
and
that
the
object
of
by
richard
dawkins
corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
active
the
by
phrase
is
optional
it
can
often
be
omitted
without
reducing
the
sentence
to
a
fragment
c
someone
has
abandoned
this
car
d
this
car
has
been
abandoned
we
distinguish
three
sentence
types
according
to
different
moods
the
declarative
the
interrogative
and
the
imperative
sentences
a
through
f
are
declarative
a.k.a
indicative
e
john
should
be
here
soon
f
fred
left
early
note
that
the
subject
of
e
john
is
before
the
auxiliary
verb
should
and
in
f
the
subject
fred
is
before
the
main
verb
left
declarative
sentences
are
typically
used
to
make
assertions
although
like
all
sentence
types
they
can
be
used
for
several
purposes
imperative
sentences
contain
neither
a
subject
nor
an
auxiliary
verb
g
get
up
h
stop
that
imperative
sentences
are
typically
used
to
give
orders
directions
and
in
structions
for
instance
the
instructions
in
cookbooks
are
typically
written
in
the
imperative
mix
the
chopped
apple
with
the
other
ingredients
and
pour
into
greased
pan
there
are
two
main
types
of
interrogative
sentences
yes/no
interroga
tives
so
called
because
they
are
used
when
a
yes
or
no
answer
is
expected
and
wh
or
information
interrogatives
which
are
used
when
a
more
elab
orate
answer
than
just
yes
or
no
is
expected
sentence
i
is
a
yes/no
inter
rogative
note
that
its
auxiliary
verb
will
comes
before
its
subject
john
i
will
john
be
here
soon
67
a
skeletal
introduction
to
english
grammarremember
that
when
a
sentence
contains
more
than
one
auxiliary
verb
it
is
the
first
of
these
that
moves

of

sentences
in

english

other
familiar
languages
sentences
are
quite
easy
to
recognize
they
typically
begin
with
a
capital
letter
and
end
with
a
period
or
its
equivalent
from
a
linguistic
point
of
view
sentences

cal
units
they
are
also
intuitively
complete
in
two
senses
first
they
may
stand

as

and

and
more
importantly
they
include
all
required
grammatical
elements

though
they

in

harley-davidson
motorcycles
the
head

cycles
is
modified
by
harley-davidson

consequently
the

denotes
just
those
motorcycles
that
are
harley-davidsons
phrases
may
include
many
modifiers
as
in
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
short-haired
cat
here
we
have
six
modifiers
each
restricting
the
potential
reference
of
the
word
cat
the
result
of
piling
on
these
modifiers
is
that
the
referent
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
all
of
them—it
must
be
a
cat
that
is
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
and
short-haired
each
modifier
acts
like
a
criterion
that
the
ultimate
referent(s
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
notice
that
modifiers
are
not
required
or
implied

and

must

distinct
we
should
always
be
clear
about
whether
we
are
discussing
sounds
or
letters
long
before
any
one
wrote
people
spoke
to
each

when
we
learned
our
first
language
81
a
skeletal
introduction
to
english
grammarwe
learned
the
spoken
version
before
we
learned
the
written
one
when
we
learned
to
read
and
write
we
probably
learned
to
associate
letters
with
sounds
first
one
letter
to
a
sound
and
vice
versa
for
example
we
learned
to
use
the
letter
s
to
represent
its
most
typical
hissing
sound
s
later
we
learned
that
many
letters
are
associated
with
several
sounds
and
vice
versa
for
example
c
sometimes
represents
the
sound
typically
associated
with
s
as
in
city
and
sometimes
the
sound
typically
associated
with
k
as
in
cat
and
sometimes
both
as
in
electric
k
and
electricity
s
sounds
are
more
basic
to
language
than
letters
letters
represent
sounds
not
the
other
way
around
having
said
that
however
we
must
also
ac
knowledge
that
in
highly
literate
societies
such
as
ours
the
written
version
of
language
has
more
prestige
than
the
spoken
version—because
it
is
gener
ally
associated
with
more
prestigious
functions
we
are
so
literate
that
even
when
we
are
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
sounds
of
our
languages
we
are
strongly
influenced
by
how
they
are
spelled
we
tend
to
see
sounds
rather
than
to
hear
them
we
hope
that
our
chapter
on
phonetics
and
phonology
will
redress
that
imbalance
letters
as
we
mentioned
are
visual
symbols
for
sounds
english
has
ap
proximately
40
sounds
that
it
uses
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
if
we
were
to
design
an
ideal
writing
system
for
a
language
like
english
we
might
consider
associating
each
significant
sound
with
a
single
letter
how
ever
our
letters
derive
from
latin
which
got
them
from
etruscan
which
got
them
from
greek
which
got
them
from
phoenician
so
they’ve
been
around
the
block
quite
a
bit
and
don’t
fit
the
language
very
consistently
there
are
only
26
of
them
to
represent
the
40
or
so
sounds
this
disparity
is
particularly
acute
among
the
vowels
for
which
we
have
just
6
symbols
counting
y
to
represent
about
a
dozen
different
vowel
sounds
i
does
at
least
double
duty
it
represents
different
sounds
in
bit
and
bite
the
silent
e
alerts
us
to
the
difference
and
many
sounds
are
represented
in
several
ways
the
sound
f
as
in
father
may
be
represented
by
the
letters
f
in
frankly
ph
in
physics
and
gh
in
enough
while
the
letters
themselves
came
to
english
and
other
european
lan
guages
from
latin
english
borrowed
lots
of
words
from
lots
of
other
lan
guages
often
keeping
a
version
of
the
original
language’s
spelling
the
result
is
that
the
way
we
spell
particular
sounds
often
depends
on
the
word
the
sound
is
in
and
where
that
word
came
from
for
example
the
sound
f
is
written
as
the
letter
f
in
native
english
words
such
as
feather
and
finger
however
the
same
sound
is
spelled
ph
in
many
words
that
were
borrowed
into
english
from
greek
such
as
phone
or
philadelphia
the
sounds
used
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
in
a
language
are
delahunty
and
garvey
82called
phonemes
p
and
b
distinguish
pat
and
bat
so
they
are
english
phonemes
but
phonemes
are
pronounced
differently
in
different
contexts
if
you
listen
carefully
you
will
notice
that
the
p
of
pat
differs
from
the
p
of
spat
the
former
p
is

meaning
our
discussion
has
depended
on
concepts
that
we
must
now
discuss
some
what
more
fully
these
are
the
notions
of
form
observable
grammatical
characteristics
function
role
or
relation
in
an
expression
and
meaning
what
an
expression
denotes
or
refers
to
the
information
encoded
by
an
expression
form
the
notion
of
form
refers
to
the
observable
elements
that
make
an
object
what
it
is
a
toothbrush
for
instance
has
the
formal
features
of
a
5”–6
long
narrow
handle
with
a
bunch
of
bristles
at
one
end
individual
toothbrushes
might
have
other
formal
characteristics
such
as
a
particular
color
particular
stiffness
of
bristles
devices
for
massaging
the
gums
etc
but
only
the
first
two
formal
features
must
be
present
for
something
to
be
identified
as
a
toothbrush
in
grammar
we
make
use
of
formal
features
to
identify
the
category
that
an
expression
belongs
to
in
the
study
of
parts
of
speech
for
example
the
form
of
a
word
comprises
its
observable
linguistic
properties
besides
whether
it
is
spoken
gestured
or
written
these
formal
features
include
a
actual
and
potential
inflectional
elements
e.g
look

these
features
serve
as
the
basic
criteria
for
identifying
parts
of
speech
for

consider
how
we
might
assign
the
word
realize

the

of

it

the

accept

tells
us
little
about
the
part
of
speech
of
realize
but
in
words
such
as
convért
verb
and
cónvert
noun
stress
provides
a
useful
clue
much
of
the
skill
involved
in
linguistic
analysis
requires
the
use
of
appropriate
formal
tests
applying
them
shows
that
a
any
word
is
potentially
a
member
of
several
different
parts
of
speech
e.g
hit
can
be
both
a
noun
and
a
verb
b
the
meaning
of
a
word
provides
no
reliable
clue
to
its
part
of
speech
e.g
verbs
are
often
characterized
as
words
that
denote
actions
or
states
but
the
words
actions
and
states
are
both
nouns
c
distinguishing
the
formal
properties
of
words

a
necessary
prelimi
nary

to

d
formal
criteria

words

in

function
the
functional
view
of

asks
what
is
an
expression’s
role
in
its
sentence
for
an
analogy
let’s
return

the

finally
some
words
such

as
modifiers
as
in

grammatical

there
is
no

in
this
case
we
have
two
headwords

as
the
headword
of

as
the

is
more
common
in
modern
linguistics
than
the

you
may
be
familiar
with

the
headword
will
typically
determine
the
grammatical
category
of
the
phrase
that
it
heads
thus
a
phrase
with
a
noun
head
will
be
a
noun
phrase
one
with
a
verb
head
will
be
a
verb
phrase
and
so
on
meaning
the
third
perspective
on
grammar
is
that
of
meaning
i.e
the
definition
of
an
expression
or
the
information
potentially
communicated
by
it
in
this
topic
we
include
the
meaning
of
words
phrases
and
whole
sentences
a
simple
example
of
lexical
word
meaning
used
in
grammatical
analysis
is
the
familiar
definition
of
a
verb
as
a
word
that
denotes
action
or
state
of
being
another
familiar
example
is
the
traditional
definition
of
the
subject
of
a
clause
as
the
doer
of
an
action
several
chapters
in
this
book
will
say
more
about
such
constructional
meanings
in
regard
to
phrases
clauses
and
entire
sentences
our
position
in
this
book
is
that
the
study
of
grammar
can
take
place
most
successfully
when
built
on
a
solid
base
of
formal
analysis
thus
our
chapters
on
parts
of
speech
identify
parts
of
speech
primarily
by
analyzing
their
forms
our
emphasis
on
form
does
not
at
all
imply
that
function
or
meaning
is
unimportant
to
language
exactly
the
opposite
is
true
and
we
do
include
functional
and
semantic
commentary
on
parts
of
speech
and
other
grammati
cal
forms
however
we
will
not
rely
solely
or
even
primarily
on
function
or
meaning
as
criteria
for
identification
as
we
proceed
to
phrases
and
clauses
we
will
be
able
to
make
a
more
extensive
use
of
the
functional
and
meaning
ful
properties
of
grammar
precisely
because
of
our
strong
formal
foundation
our
goal
is
to
help
you
make
appropriate
use
of
all
these
facets
in
your
think
ing
and
teaching
about
language

and

introduction
in
this
chapter
we
sketch
the
pronunciation
system
of
english
we
begin
with
phonetics
a
system
for
describing
and
recording
the
sounds
of
lan
guage
objectively
phonetics
provides
a
valuable
way
of
opening
our
ears
to
facets
of
language
that
we
tend
to
understand
by
reference
to
their
written
rather
than
their
actual
spoken
forms
phonology
concerns
itself
with
the
ways
in
which
languages
make
use
of
sounds
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
teachers
should
be
knowledgeable
about
the
phonetics
and
phonology
of
english
because
1
the
sound
system
is
primary
and
the
basis
for
the
spelling
system
2
they
may
have
to
teach
english
pronunciation
to
stu
dents
who
are
not
native
speakers
of
english
3
they
may
have
to
teach
poetry
which
requires
that
they
teach
about
rhyme
alliteration
assonance
and
other
poetic
devices
that
manipulate
sound
4
it
is
important
to
un
derstand
accents
and
language
variation
and
to
react
appropriately
to
them
and
to
teach
appropriate
language
attitudes
about
them
to
students
see
our
chapters
on
language
and

we
are
so
liter
ate
that
we
tend
to
hear
the
sounds
of
our
language
through
its
spelling
system
and
phonetics
phonology
provides
a
corrective
to
that
and
6
pho
netics
and
phonology
provide
systematic
and
well-founded
understandings
of
the
sound
patterns
of
english
articulatory
phonetics
we
have
three
goals
in
this
section
first
we
introduce
you
to
the
ways
in
which
the
sounds
of
english
are
produced
second
we
develop
a
system
for
classifying
speech
sounds
on
the
basis
of
how
they
are
produced
simultane
ously
we
introduce
an
alphabet
approximating
that
developed
by
the
inter
national
phonetics
association
ipa
which
will
allow
us
to
refer
to
sounds
quite
precisely
when
we
want
to
indicate
that
letters
are
to
be
interpreted
as
phonetic
symbols
we
enclose
them
in
square
brackets
and
when
we
want
to
indicate
that
letters
are
to
be
interpreted
as
letters
from
an
ordinary
spelling
system
we
enclose
them
in
angled
brackets
delahunty
and
garvey
90
the
phonetic
alphabet
uses
many
of
the
letters
of
the
english
alphabet
but
their
pronunciations
are
very
restricted
and
are
not
always
the
ones
you
might
expect
in
this
system
there
are
no
silent
letters—every
phonetic
symbol
represents
an
actual
sound
every
letter
always
has
the
same
pronunciation
regardless
of
its
context
no
letter
has
more
than
one
pronunciation
and
no
sounds
are
represented
by
more
than
one
letter
to
make
fine
distinctions
phoneticians
add
special
symbols
called
diacritics
to
the
basic
letters
for
some
english
sounds
and
for
languages
other
than
english
symbols
not
from
the
english
alphabet
have
been
devised
you
might
visit
the
ipa
web
site
for
a
full
listing
of
the
symbols
in
the
sections
to
follow
we
describe
the
sounds
represented
by
these
symbols
and
how
these
sounds
are
made
as
we
go
through
these
sections
pay
attention
to
the
ways
in
which
individual
sounds
are
ordinarily
spelled
in
english
as
well
as
to
the
phonetic
spellings
to
produce
speech
air
must
flow
from
the
lungs
through
the
vocal
tract
which
includes
the
vocal
folds
popularly
called
the
vocal
cords
though
they
are
more
like
thick
elastic
bands
than
strings
the
nose
or

ity
and
the
mouth
or

approximants
are

are
more
sonorant
resonant
i.e
naturally
loud
than

three
kinds
of

lateral
approximants
are

alveolar
ridge

air
to
pass
along
one
or
both
sides
as
in

lack
call
and
callow
central
approximants
are
made
by
raising
the
sides
of
the

so

of

hint
they
can
occur
in
open
syllables
a
second
set
of
english
diphthongs
is
not
as
clearly
distinguished
as
the
first
primarily
because
we
tend
to
perceive
them
as
simple
vowels
however
in
a
precise
narrow
phonetic
transcription
they
must
be
represented
as
diphthongs
the
tense
front
vowel
e
is
diphthongized
if
you
listen
care
fully
you
will
notice
that
the
vowel
of
bate
is
actually
pronounced
ei
the
tense
back
vowel
o
is
also
diphthongized
if
you
listen
carefully
you
will
notice
that
the
vowel
of
boat
is
actually
pronounced
ou
so
the
front
tense
vowel
is
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
front
vowel
and
the
back
tense
vowel
is
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
back
vowel
we
can
express
this
pattern
as
a
rule
mid
and
high
tense
vowels
are
diphthongized
by
the
addition
of
a
high
lax
vowel
that
matches
the
original
vowel
in
frontness
or
backness
diphthongization
of
these
vowels
is
a
feature
of
english
rather
than
a
universal
feature
of
natural
language
other
languages
notably
spanish
and
german
do
not
diphthongize
their
corresponding
vowels
the
tendency
to
diphthongize
these
vowels
is
one
characteristic
of
the
foreign
accent
that
betrays
english
speakers
when
they
begin
to
learn
these
languages
syllables
and
feet
it’s
a
lot
easier
to
count
syllables
than
to
give
them
a
satisfactory
definition
if
the
entire
class
were
to
count
the
syllables
in
this
paragraph
there
would
be
considerable
agreement
about
the
number
but
probably
not
about
where
each
syllable
begins
and
ends
the
fact
that
syllabic
writing
systems
devel
oped
before
alphabetic
systems
see
our

chapter
in

sug
gests
that
syllables
are

units

to
be
able
to
associate
symbols
with
syllables
before
they
can
associate

delahunty
and

106with

segments
also
points
to
the
importance
of
the
syllable
every
syllable
symbolized
as
$
consists
of
at
least
a
nucleus
symbolized
as
n
which
is
typically
a
vowel
the
nucleus
may
be
preceded
by
an
onset
symbolized
as
o
consisting
of
one
or
more
consonants
and
followed
by
a
coda
symbolized
as
c
again
consisting
of
one
or
more
consonants
the
nucleus
and
the
coda
together
make
up
a

we
explore

and
the
basic
unit
of

analysis
the
phoneme
phonemes
you
might
reasonably
have
assumed
that
whenever
speakers
distinguish
be
tween
a
pair
of
sounds
they
will
use
that
difference
to
distinguish
between
words
for
example
we
know
that
english
speakers
distinguish
between
s
and
z
and
we
use
this
difference
to
signal
the
difference
between
the
words
sip
and
zip
we
will
say
that
s
and
z
contrast
with
each
other
in
english
in
fact
all
of
the
sounds
we
have
described
so
far
contrast
with
each
other
in
english
and
so
are
used
by
english
speakers
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
you
can
test
this
out
by
taking
any
pair
of
sounds
as
we
took
s
and
z
and
creating
a
pair
of
words
like
sip
and
zip
which
are
identical
except
that
where
one
has
one
sound
the
other
has
the
other
sound
just
as
where
sip
has
s
zip
has
z
pairs
of
words
like
this
are
called
minimal
pairs
and
are
used
to
demonstrate
that
pairs
of
sounds
are
used
in
a
language
to
distinguish
words
from
each
other
sound
units
that
distinguish
words
from
each
other
are
called

we
enclose
phonemes
in
e.g
s
z
to
distinguish
them
from
sounds
s
z
and

exercise
phonemes
are
most
easily
identified
through

thus
pete

you

now
listen
to
the
conso

after
the
vowels
are
these
the
same
or
different
again
we
hope
you
said
different
and
that
you
know
that
t
is
voiceless
and
d
is
voiced
now
which
vowel
the
longer
or
the
shorter
precedes
d
and
which
precedes
t
we
hope
you
said
that
the
longer
vowel
precedes
the
voiced

are
the
two
vowels
similar
in
any
way
again
we
hope
you
said
that
they
seem
to
be
longer
and
shorter
versions
of
the

vowel

let’s
use
to
indicate
extra
length
so
the
vowel
before
voiceless
t
is
just

but
the
one
before

d
is

now
let’s
listen
to
some
more
word
pairs
like
cat
and
cad
root
rood
moat
mode
leaf
leave
gape
gabe
listen
to
the
vowels
in
each
pair
you
should
hear
that
the
vowel
in
the
sec
ond
word
in
each
pair
is
a
little
longer
than
the
vowel
in
the
first
now
determine
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
consonants
after
the
vowels
in
each
word
pair
you
should
find
that
the
consonant
in
the
first
word
is
the
voiceless
version
of
the
consonant
in
the
second
word
t
urning
our
attention
again
to
the
vowels
in
each
word
pair
how
are
they
related
we
hope
you
said
that
they
were
very
similar
vowels
specifi
cally
short
and
long
versions
of
the
same
vowel
you
should
now
be
able
to
determine
a
very
general
rule
of
english
when
are
vowels
lengthened
and
when
are
they
not
lengthened
your
answer
should
be
something
along
the
lines
of
english
vowels
are
lengthened
when
they
occur
before
a
voiced
consonant
otherwise
they
are
not
lengthened
so
far
we’ve
seen

and

u
and
u
o
and
o
i
and
i
and
e
and
e
in
each
case
the
longer
vowel
occurs
before
a
voiced
consonant
we’ve
also
noted
that
the
vowels
are
otherwise
virtually
identical—they
dif
fer
only
in
length
so
it
makes
good
sense
to
regard
these
pairs
of
vowel
sounds
as
slightly
different
pronunciations
of
the
same
vowel
and
that
whether
the
vowel
is
lengthened
or
not
depends
on
whether
the
consonant
that
follows
it
is
voiced
or
not
importantly
the
long
and
short
pairs
of
vowels
do
not
contrast
with
each
other
english
contains
no
pairs
of
words
that
are
identical
except
that
where
one
contains
a
short
version
of
a
vowel
the
other
contains
the
longer
version
of
the

vowel
consequently
the
long
and
short
versions
of
delahunty
and
garvey
110vowels
do
not
represent
separate
phonemes
let’s
now
turn
our
attention
to
some
consonants
for
example
english
speakers
pronounce
the
t
in
toll
differently
from
that
in
stole
the
t
of
toll
is
breathier
than
the
t
of
stole
the
former
is
said
to
be
aspirated
and
the
latter
unaspirated
we
represent
the
aspirated
t
as
th
with
the
diacritic
h
indicating
aspiration
we
represent
the
unaspirated
t
as
t
with
no
dia
critic
the
important
point
here
is
that
english
speakers
do
not
signal
any
difference
in
meaning
with
the
difference
between
th
and
t
they
treat
the
two
sounds
as
variant
ways
of
pronouncing
the
the
same
sound
sub
stituting
one
of
these
sounds
for
the
other
would
not
affect
the
meaning
of
a
word
but
it
would
create
an
odd
and
perhaps
non-native
pronunciation
of
the
word
no
pair
of
english
words
is
distinguished
solely
by
the
difference
between
t
and
th
you
can
satisfy
yourself
that
this
is
so
by
trying
to
find
a
minimal
pair
of
english
words
differentiated
solely
by
the
fact
that
where
one
has
an
aspirated
consonant
the
other
has
an
unaspirated
version
of
that
same
consonant
don’t
spend
too
long
trying
let’s
now
look
at
a
different
pair
of
english
sounds
if
we
replace
the
t
in
r
at
rot
with
d
then
we
get
the
sequence
of
sounds
r
ad
rod
which
of
course
is
quite
distinct
in
meaning
from
rot
clearly
english
speakers
treat
the
difference
between
d
and
t
differently
from
the
way
they
treat
the
difference
between
th
and
t
and
between
longer
and
shorter
versions
of
vowels
in
the
case
of
t
and
d
the
difference
can
signal
a
difference
in
meaning
in
the
other
cases
it
cannot
differences
in
sound
that
signal
differences
in
meaning
are
said
to
be
phonemic
distinctive
or
contrastive
differences
in
sound
that
do
not
signal
meaning
differences
are
non
distinctive
or
non-contrastive
one
objective
of
phonology
is
to
identify
which
sound
differences
are
contrastive
and
which
are
not
as
we
have
seen
the
contrastive
sound
units
are
called
phonemes
phonemes
and
allophones
a
good
way
to
think
about
a
phoneme
is
as
a
group
of
phonetically
similar
sounds
that
are
treated
as
members
of
the
same
sound
category
because
the
members
of
a
sound
category
are
treated
as
the
same
sound
in
a
language
they
cannot
be
used
for
communicating
differences
in
meaning
english
speakers
treat
th
and
t
as
belonging
to
the
same
sound
category
so
they
cannot
be
used
to
distinguish
one
word
from
another
different
phonemes
are
different
categories
of
sounds
and
the
differences
among
these
catego
ries
can
signal
differences
in
meaning
english
speakers
treat
t
and
d
as
belonging
to
different
sound
categories—/t
and
d
respectively—and
so
111
phonetics
and
phonologythese
can
be
used
to
differentiate
one
word
from
another
sound
categories
are
abstractions
we
can
only
perceive
them
when
one
of
their
members
is
pronounced
the
sounds
that
make
up
the
category
are
called
the
allophones
of
that
phoneme
thus
t
and
th
are
allophones
of
the
english
phoneme
t
notice
that
the
individual
sound
symbols
are
the
same
as
those
we
used
for
phonetics
but
to
distinguish
phonology
from
phonetics
we
enclose
phonemes
in
slanted
brackets
and
use
square
brackets
for
phonetic
notation
perhaps
the
following
diagram

help

allophones
and
their

we
have
already
noted
that
if
we
substitute
the
aspirated
allophone
of
t
for
its
unaspirated
relative
then
we
create
an
odd
pronunciation
of
a
word
til
is
the
typical
american
english
pronunciation
of
till
but
til
is
not
what
if
any
patterns
can
we
observe
in
where
allophones
of
a
phoneme
can
and
cannot
occur
some
allophones
of
a
phoneme
are
in
complementary
distribution
that
is
they
occupy
different
positions
contexts
or
environments
in
words—where
one
can
occur
the
other
cannot
as
we
have
seen
english
has
a
very
general
pattern
of
lengthening
vowels
before
voiced
consonants
that
is
the
allophone
of
a
vowel
phoneme
before
a
voiced
consonant
will
be
appreciably
longer
up
to
three
times
longer
than
the
allophone
of
the
same
vowel
phoneme
before
a
voiceless
consonant
for
example
listen
to
the
pronunciation
of
e
in
bet
and
bed
you
should
have
little
difficulty
in
hearing
the
difference
in
vowel
length
we
can
represent
the
pattern
of
oc
currence
distribution
of
these
two
allophones
of
the
phoneme
e
as
the
following
phonological
rule
when
the
phoneme
e
occurs
before
a
voiceless
consonant
it
is
pronounced
as
its
allophone
e
when
it
occurs
before
a
voiced
consonant
it
is
pronounced
as
its
allophone
e
remember
is
a
diacritic
indicating
a
lengthened
sound
in
fact
the
rule
is
much
more
general
than
this
because
it
applies
to
all
vowels
we
can
write
it
as
in
english
a
vowel
is
longer
before
a
voiced
consonant
than
it
is
before
a
voiceless
one
one
of
our
objectives
in
studying
a
language
is
to
be
able
to
describe
these
sound
patterns
i.e
to
be
able
to
specify
in
the
most
general
terms
possible
the
phonetic
environments
in
which
each
allophone
occurs
let’s
look
at
another
very
systematic
set
of
english
vowel
allophones
the
vowels
of
cap
and
can
differ
phonetically
that
of
cap
is
a
plain

that
of
can
is
nasalized
represented
by
~~
if
you
have
trouble
hearing
the
difference
try
starting
to
say
each
word
normally
and
then
omit
the
final
consonant
the
phoneme

thus
has
the
allophones

and
~
in
fact
all
english
vowels
have
both
nasalized
and
non-nasalized
allophones
we
can
represent
this
as
the
rule
whenever
an
english
vowel
occurs
before
a
nasal
consonant
it
becomes
nasalized
otherwise
it
is
non-nasalized
113
phonetics
and
phonology
in
fact
the
situation
is
a
bit
more
intricate
that
this
because
nasals
are
voiced
we
should
expect
a
vowel
before
them
to
be
lengthened
relative
to
the
same
vowel
before
a
voiceless
sound
and
indeed
this
is
what
we
find
listen
to
the
vowels
in
cat
cad
and
can
you
should
notice
that
the
first
vowel
is
unlengthened

the
second
one
is
lengthened

and
the
third
one
is
both
lengthened
in
fact
probably
even
more
than
the
second
one
and
nasalized
~

phonological
rules
as
we
saw
above
a
phonological
rule
is
a
general
statement
about
the
distribution
of
a
phoneme’s
allophones
e.g
those
of
t
there
are
several
types
of
phonological
rules
to
represent
the
several
patterns
of
distribution
of
sounds
in
a
language
the
rule
for
the
th
allophone
of
t
can
be
seen
as
adding
extra
breathi
ness
after
the
release
of
a
voiceless
stop
this
rule
adds
the
aspiration
feature
to
the

such
rules
are

as

the

due
as
we’ve
seen
to
the
influ
ence

words

that

the

only

fore
nasal
consonants
the
non-nasalized
ones
occur
everywhere
else
if
we
merely
listed
all
these
vowels
as
belonging
to
the
language
then
we
would
have
postulated
far
more
basic
units
than
we—or
native
speakers—really
need
and
we
would
have
missed
the
generalization
that
the
two
series

vowels
are
really
quite
alike
one
series
being
merely
a
predictable
positional
delahunty

garvey
116variant
of
the

we
capture
this
generalization
by
eliminating
the

of

from

replacing
it
with

this

is
about

and
their
internal

we
believe
that
this
information
will
be
of
value
to
anyone
interested
in
words
for
whatever
reason
to
anyone
inter
ested
in

and
how
they
represent
the
aspects
of
words
we
deal
with
here
to
anyone
involved
in

of

to

who
must

with
the

created
by
the
fact
that
different
communities
of
english
speakers
use
different
word

if
not
what
are
they
words
and
morphemes
in
traditional
grammar
words
are
the
basic
units
of
analysis
grammarians
classify
words
according
to
their
parts
of
speech
and
identify
and
list
the
forms
that
words
can
show
up
in
although
the
matter
is
really
very
com
plex
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
we
will
begin
with
the
assumption
that
we
are
all
generally
able
to
distinguish
words
from
other
linguistic
units
it
will
be
sufficient
for
our
initial
purposes
if
we
assume
that
words
are
the
main
units
used
for
entries
in
dictionaries
in
a
later
section
we
will
briefly
describe
some
of
their
distinctive
characteristics
words
are
potentially
complex
units
composed
of
even
more
basic
units
called
morphemes
a
morpheme
is
the
smallest
part
of
a
word
that
has
grammatical
function
or
meaning
nb
not
the
smallest
unit
of
meaning
we
will
designate
them
in
braces
for
example
sawed
sawn
sawing
and
saws
can
all
be
analyzed
into
the
morphemes
saw
+
ed
n
ing
and
s
respectively
none
of
these
last
four
can
be
further
divided
into
meaningful
units
and
each
occurs
in
many
other
words
such
as
looked
mown
cough
ing
bakes
saw
can
occur
on
its
own
as
a
word
it
does
not
have
to
be
attached
to
another
morpheme
it
is
a
free
morpheme
however
none
of
the
other
morphemes
listed
just
above
is
free
each
must
be
affixed
attached
to
some
other
unit
each
can
only
occur
as
a
part
of
a
word
morphemes
that
must
be
attached
as
word
parts
are
said
to
be
bound

we

as
the

left
over
when
all
the
derivational

inflectional
morphemes
have
been
removed
for
example
in
immovability
im

ity
are
all
derivational
morphemes
and
when
we
remove
them
we
are
left
with
move
which
cannot
be
further
di
vided
into
meaningful
pieces
and
so
must
be
the
word’s
root
we
must
distinguish
between
a

root
and
the
forms
to
which
af

are
attached
in

able
is
attached
to
move
which
we’ve
determined
is
the

however
im

not
to

there
is
no
word
immove
but
moveable
is
not
a

expressions
to
which

are
called

just

does
it

these

their

but
also
the
fact
that
each
contains
an
alveolar

phoneme
either

the
three
forms
are
in
comple

given
the

similarities
between

and
the
fact
that
they
are
in
complementary
distribution
it
is
reasonable
to
view
them
as
contex
tual
pronunciation
variants
of
a
single
entity
in
parallel
with
phonology
we
will
refer
to
the
entity
of
which
the
three
are
variant
representations
as
a
morpheme
and
the
variant
forms
of
a

as
its

when
we

to

words
words
are
notoriously
difficult
entities
to
define
both
in
universal
and
in
language
specific
terms
like
most
linguistic
entities
they
look
in
two
direc
tions—upward
toward
larger
units
of
which
they
are
parts
toward
phrases
and
downward
toward
their
constituent
morphemes
this
however
only
helps
us
understand
words
if
we
already
understand
how
they
are
combined
into
larger
units
or
divided
into
smaller
ones
so
we

discuss

other
criteria
that

we
tend
to
regard

any

within
it
and
is
separated
by

because
of

english
like
all
lan

has
many
irregular
forms
which
may
be
irregular
in
a
variety
of
ways
first
irregular
words
may
use
different
inflections
than
regular
ones
for
example
the
modern
past

the

and
the

irregular
forms
may
involve
internal
vowel
changes
as

some

irregular

here
we
must
note
that
different
groups
of
english
speak
ers
use
different
inflected
forms
of
words
especially
of
verbs
when
this
is
the
case
the
standard
variety
of
the
language
typically
selects
one
and
rejects
the
others
as
non-standard
or
illogically
as
not
english
or
worse
for
example
many
english
speakers
use
a
single
form
of
be
in
the
past

was
regardless
of
what
the
subject
of
its
clause
is
so
they

say

because

nonetheless
we
are
justified
in
classifying
all

regardless

for
a
variety
of
reasons
first
the

of

the

this

it
is

generally

that
it

the

so
because
the
meanings
of

are
not
always

from
the

of

dictionaries
often
provide
individual

for

they
do
not
do
this
for

unless
the

is
idi

therefore
not
derivable
from
the

of
its

and
how
they

e.g

cats

generally
the
meaning
of
a
phrase
is
predictable
from
the
meanings
of
its
constituents
and
so
phrases
need
not
be

individually
indeed
because
the
number
of

in

is

it
is

an
alternative
approach
is
to
classify
compounds
in
terms
of
the
seman
tic
relationship
between
the
compound
and
its
head
the
head
of
a
com
135
morphology
and
word
formationpound
is
the
constituent
modified
by
the
compound’s
other
constituents
in
english
heads
of
compounds
are
typically
the
rightmost
constituent
ex
cluding
any
derivational
and
inflectional
suffixes
for
example
in
traffic-cop
the
head
is
cop
which
is
modified
by
traffic
in
line-backer
the
head
is
backer
which
is
modified
by
line
linguists
distinguish
at
least
three
different
se
mantic
relations
between
the
head
and
modifier(s
of
compounds
first
the
compound
represents
a
subtype
of
whatever
the
head
repre
sents
for
instance
a
traffic-cop
is
a
kind
of
cop
a
teapot
is
a
kind
of
pot
a
fog-lamp
is
a
kind
of
lamp
a
blue-jay
is
a
kind
of
jay
that
is
the
head
names
the
type
and
the
compound
names
the
subtype
these
are
called
endocen
tric
compounds
second
the
compound
names
a
subtype
but
the
type
is
not
represented
by
either
the
head
or
the
modifier
in
the
compound
for
example
dead
head
redhead
and
pickpocket
represent
types
of
people
by
denoting
some
distinguishing
characteristic
there
is
typically
another
word
not
included
in
the
compound
that
represents
the
type
of
which
the
compound
repre
sents
the
subtype
in
the
case
of
deadhead
redhead
and
pickpocket
this
other
word
is
person
so
a
deadhead
is
a
person
who
is
an
enthusiastic
fan
of
the
band
the
grateful
dead
these
are
called
exocentric
compounds
third
there
are
compounds
in
which
both
elements
are
heads
each
con
tributes
equally
to
the
meaning
of
the
whole
and
neither
is
subordinate
to
the
other
for
instance
bitter-sweet
compounds
like
these
can
be
para
phrased
as
both
x
and
y
e.g
bitter
and
sweet
other
examples
include
teacher-researcher
and
producer-director
these
can
be
called
coordinative
compounds

each
set
of
words

whether
the
words
are
endocentric
exocentric

coining
is
the
creation
of
new

without

to
the
existing
morphological
resources
of
the

that

we
may
simply
lop

united

figure
alternatively
we
may
use
the
first
letter
of
each
word
in
a
phrase
to
create
a
new
expression
an
acronym
as
in

in
these
instances
the

pronounced
as
a
sequence
of
letter
names
in
other
instances
such
as

international
children’s
emergency

the
acronym
can
be
pronounced
as
an
ordinary
english
word
advertisers
make
prolific
use
of
acronyms
and
often
try
to
make
them
pronounceable
as
ordinary

blending
involves
taking
two
or
more
words
removing
parts
of
each
and
joining
the
residues
together
to
create
a
new
word
whose
form
and
meaning
are
taken
from
the
source
words
smog
derives
from
smoke
and
fog
and
means
a
combination
of
these
two
substances
and
probably
lots
of
others
motel
derives
from
motor

hotel
and
refers
to

are
con
venient
in
various
ways
to

borrowing
involves
copying
a
word
that
originally
belonged
in
one
lan
guage
into
another
language
for
instance
many
terms
from
mexican
cui
sine
like
taco
and
burrito
have
become
current
in
american
english
and
are
spreading
to
other
english
dialects
borrowing
requires
that
the
borrowing
language
and
the
source
language
come
in
contact
with
each
other
speak
ers
of
the
borrowing
language
must
learn
at
least
some
minimum
of
the
source
language
for
the
borrowing
to
take
place
over
its
1500
year
history
english
has
borrowed
from
hundreds
of
languages
though
the
main
ones
are
latin
homicide
greek
chorus
french
mutton
italian
aria
span
ish
ranch
german

from
native
american
languages
american
english
has
borrowed
place
names
chicago
river
names
mississippi
animal
names
opossum
and
plant
names
hickory
the
borrowed
word
never
remains
a
perfect
copy
of
its
original
it
is
made
to
fit
the
phonological
morphological
and
syntactic
patterns
of
its
new
language
for
example
the
spanish
pronunciation
of
burritos
is
very
different
from
the
english
pronunciation
at
the
very
least
the

registers
and
words
although
most
of
the
words
we
use
every
day
can
be
used
in
almost
any
context
many
words
of
the
language
are
restricted
to
uses
in
certain
fields
disciplines
professions
or
activities
i.e
registers
for
example
the
word
phoneme
is
restricted
to
the
linguistic
domain
interestingly
some
words
may
be
used
in
several
domains
with
a
different
meaning
in
each
though
these
meanings
may
be
a
specific
version
of
a
more
general
meaning
for
ex
ample
the
word
morphology
is
used
in
linguistics
to
refer
to
the
study
of
the
internal
structure
of
words
and
their
derivational
relationships
in
botany
to
refer
to
the
forms
of
plants
in
geology
to
refer
to
rock
formations
the
general
abstract
meaning
underlying
these
specific
meanings
is
the
study
of
form
besides
words
that
may
be
used
in
almost
any
context
and
those
that
are
technical
or
discipline
specific
there

must
be

to
the

dropout
not

out
to
which

the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
plural
suffix
may
be
attached
to
nouns
but
not
to
verbs

particles
drop

constitute
a

only
after

let’s

the

we
have
the
adjectives
doable
manage
able

attachable
which

this

an

able

the

to
a

on
that
basis
likewise
adverbs
such
as
hard
or
fast
lack
the
characteristic

it
becomes
necessary
to

introduction
in
every
language
we
find
groups
of
words
that
share
grammatical
charac
teristics
these
groups
are
called
parts
of
speech
and
we
examine
them
in
this
chapter
and
the
next
though
many
writers
on
language
refer
to
the
eight
parts
of
speech
e.g
weaver
1996
254
the
actual
number
of
parts
of
speech
we
need
to
recognize
in
a
language
is
determined
by
how
fine
grained
our
analysis
of
the
language
is—the
more
fine-grained
the
greater
the
number
of
parts
of
speech
that
will
be
distinguished
in
this
book
we
distinguish
nouns
verbs
adjectives
and
adverbs
the
major
parts
of
speech
and
pronouns
wh-words
articles
auxiliary
verbs
prepositions
intensifiers
conjunctions
and

the
minor
parts
of
speech
every
literate
person
needs
at
least
a
minimal
understanding
of
parts
of
speech
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
such
commonplace
items
as
diction
aries
and
thesauruses
which
classify
words
according
to
their
parts
and
sub-parts
of

teachers
need
to
know
about
parts
of
speech
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
and
teach
about
style
manuals
and
school
grammars
regardless
of
their
discipline
teachers
need
this
information
to
be
able
to
help
students
expand
the
contexts
in
which
they
can
effectively
communicate
a
part
of
speech
is
a
set
of
words
with
some
grammatical
characteristic(s
in
common
and
each
part
of
speech
differs
in
grammatical
characteristics
from
every
other
part
of
speech
e.g
nouns
have
different
properties
from
verbs
which
have
different
properties
from
adjectives
and
so
on
part
of
speech
analysis
depends
on
knowing
or
discovering
the
distinguishing
properties
of
the
various
word
sets
this
chapter
describes
several
kinds
of
properties
that
separate
the
major
parts
of
speech
from
each
other
and
de
delahunty
and

several
ways
in
which
to
identify
a
word’s
part
of
speech
the
major
parts
of
speech
nouns
verbs
adjectives
adverbs
the
major
parts
of
speech
contribute
the
major
content
to
a
message
and
hence
are
sometimes
called
content
words
as
opposed
to
other
parts
of
speech
known
as
function
or
structure
words
the
content
words
are
the
ones
that
we
see
in
newspaper
headlines
where
space
is
at
a
premium
and
they
are
the
words
we
tend
to
keep
in
text
messaging
where
costs
per
word
can
be
high
however
in
most
types
of
discourse
function
words
significantly
outnumber
content
words
we
begin
our
discussion
of
each
part
of
speech
by
examining
its
tradi
tional
definition
which
is
generally
either
semantic
or
functional
we
evalu
ate
the
traditional
treatment
and
suggest
more
effective
means
of
classify
ing
the
word
type
by
referring
to
its
formal
characteristics
these
include
a
word’s
potential
inflectional
morphology
its
actual
derivational
morphol
ogy
and
the
positions
in
phrases
and
clauses
in
which
it
may
occur
for
example
the
word
kingdom
is
a
noun
because
it
can
be
inflected
for
plural
kingdom
s
it
ends
in
the
noun
creating
suffix
dom
and
it
can
occur
after
the
the
kingdom
we
also
examine
some
of
the
major
functions
of
each
part
of
speech
each
section
concludes
with
a
discussion
of
subclasses
of
the
larger
class
nouns
t
raditionally
a
noun
is
defined
as
a
word
that
names
a
person
place
thing
or
idea
weaver
1996
252
this
defines
the
noun
category
according
to
what
its
members
are
assumed
to
typically
denote
so
it
is
a
meaning-based
or
semantic
definition
occasionally
this
definition
gets
abbreviated
to
a
noun
is
a
person
place
or
thing
which
makes
no
sense
at
all
by
weaver’s
definition
madonna
pittsburgh
and
godzilla
are
all
nouns
which
is
cor
rect
so
the
definition
provides
a
useful
start
however
if
we
apply
it
pre
cisely
and
to
be
worth
keeping
definitions
should
be
precisely
applicable
then
the
word
desk
is
not
a
noun
because
it
denotes
not
a
thing
but
a
whole
class
of
things
most
nouns
are
like
desk
in
this
regard
peacock
denotes
not
a
peacock
but
all
the
peacocks
living
now
as
well
as
all
those
that
existed
before
all
those
that
will
ever
exist
and
all
the
peacocks
that
we
merely
imagine
if
we
want
to
refer
to
one
peacock
we
have
to
add
a
modifier
such
as
a—a
peacock
cf
a
desk
a
book
a
hard
drive
we
might
revise
our
defi
nition
to
take
such
nouns
into
account—“nouns
name
classes
of
persons
places
things
and
ideas
but
now
we
require
pittsburgh
to
refer
not
to
one
149
the
major
parts
of
speechpittsburgh
but
to
a
whole
set
of
them
which
doesn’t
seem
quite
right
so
there
is
something
right
about
saying
that
nouns
name
classes
of
things
but
there
also
seem
to
be
nouns
that
name
individual
things
the
nouns
that
name
classes
of
things
are
common
nouns
the
nouns
and
other
types
of
expression
that
name
individual
things
are
proper
nouns
printer
is
a
common
noun
denver
is
a
proper
noun
in
english
we
conventionally
capitalize
the
initial
letter
of
proper
nouns
a
common
noun
can
be
turned
into
a
proper
noun
in
which
case
it
should
be
capitalized
for
instance
we
have
a
friend
whose
dog’s
name
is
dog
similarly
we
can
distinguish
god
of
which
there
may
be
many
from
god
which
is
presumed
to
be
unique—at
least
in
some
contexts
proper
nouns
name
individual
things
but
these
things
are
many
and
var
ied
they
include
individual
people
madonna
individual
animals
lassie
individual
places
addis
ababa
individual
things
earth
we’ll
have
a
lot
more
to
say
about
proper
names
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
we’ve
said
that
common
nouns
name
classes
of
things
but
this
needs
development
certainly
books
are
things
but
is
grease
a
thing
thing
seems
to
us
to
denote
only
things
that
can
be
individuated
and
counted
thing
one
thing
two
one
potato
two
potatoes
and
so
on
but
grease
doesn’t
seem
to
allow
this
we
don’t
at
least
not
typically
say
two
greases
or
even
just
one
grease
grease
is
like
milk
and
information
and
lots
of
other
similar
words
in
that
it
seems
to
denote
stuff
physical
or
mental
rather
than
individual
things
so
we
might
revise
our
definition
of
noun
again
and
say
that
com
mon
nouns
name
classes
of
things
and
stuff
or
if
you
prefer
to
go
uptown
nouns
name
classes
of
entities
and
substances
we’ll
return
to
this
issue
be
low
when
we
distinguish
more
fully
between
count
and
non-count
nouns
unfortunately
characterizing
nouns
as
names
of
things
and
stuff
only
works
if
we
limit
our
interpretation
of
things
and
stuff
to
just
what
nouns
name
which
makes
it
utterly
circular
moreover
if
we
answer
yes
when
asked
whether
events
actions
states
characteristics
and
relationships
are
things
then
we
must
allow
that
verbs
adjectives
and
other
parts
of
speech
also
name
things
but
surely
that’s
a
bit
of
a
problem
because
verbs
have
traditionally
been
assumed
to
name
actions
and
states
of
being
adjectives
to
name
characteristics
and
prepositions
to
name
relationships
our
focus
on
the
typical
meanings
of
nouns
is
what
has
gotten
us
into
this
fix
so
we
must
look
at
other
characteristics
of
nouns
if
we
are
to
have
any
success
in
finding
ways
to
identify
them
we’ve
worked
through
the
definition
of
noun
as
thoroughly
as
we
did
because
we
take
definitions
seriously
we
think
they
should
be
accurate
remember
our
discussion
of
critical
thinking
in
our
introduction
to
this
delahunty
and
garvey
150book
imagine
looking
up
the
word
dugong
in
a
dictionary
and
finding
it
defined
merely
as
a
kind
of
animal
such
a
definition
won’t
help
us
use
the
word
accurately
likewise
if
we
are
to
use
the
word
noun
accurately
then
we
need
to
define
it
accurately
we
need
accurate
definitions
of
parts
of
speech
to
allow
us
to
accurately
determine
which
categories
words
belong
to
and
this
is
important
because
a
word’s
part
of
speech
determines
whether
and
how
it
can
be
inflected
as
well
as
its
roles
in
phrases
and
sentences
we
want
our
definitions
to
provide
us
with
criteria
by
which
we
can
accurately
determine
the
part
of
speech
of
any
word
we
choose
to
examine
for
better
analyses
we
must
consider
the
forms
of
words
formal
characteristics
of
nouns
we
approach
the
classification
of
nouns
and
of
the
other
major
parts
of
speech
through
a
series
of
simple
formal
tests
however
because
no
single
test
will
always
lead
to
reliable
results
part-of-speech
identification
requires
multi
ple
criteria
and
tests
of
different
types
we
cannot
rely
on
a
single
test
because
our
tests
are
like
any
scientific
tests—sometimes
they
give
false
positive
results
e.g
they
tell
us
that
we
are
ill
when
we
aren’t
and
sometimes
false
negatives
e.g
they
tell
us
that
we
are
well
when
we
are
ill
this
is
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
each
part
of
speech
includes
many
sub-categories
each
of
which
has
slightly
different
properties
from
the
other
sub-categories
and
which
therefore
respond
somewhat
differently
to
our
tests
as
a
result
we
have
to
interpret
our
test
results
cautiously
we
say
that
a
word
belongs
to
a
particular
part
of
speech
to
the
extent
that
it
passes
the
various
tests
for
that

hint
look

of

in

a
common
role
of

morphemes
in
a
language
is
to
change
words
of
one
part
of

into
related
words
of
another
part
of
speech
thus
the
verb
tolerate
becomes
the
noun
toleration
likewise
the
verb
act
becomes
the
adjective
active
which
becomes
the
noun
activity
by
the
addition
of
their
respective
suffixes
sometimes
derivation
will
change
a
word
to
a
different
subclass
of
the
same
part
of
speech
with
a
different
though
related
mean
ing
for
example
the
suffix
hood
turns
the
noun
knight
into
the
noun
knighthood
just
as
dom
turns
the
noun
king
into
the

the
major
parts
of
speechfunctional
characteristics
of
nouns
nouns
have
two
main
functions
the
first
and
perhaps
less
important
one
is
that
of
modifier
of
other
nouns
e.g
metal
door
linguistics
class
the
more
dominant
function
is
that
of
being
the
head
of
a
noun
phrase
many
functions
traditionally
associated
with
nouns
e.g
subject
direct
and
in
direct
object
of
clauses
object
of
a
preposition
subject
and
object
comple
ment
are
really
the
functions
of
noun
phrases
hence
we
will
postpone
discussion
of
these
functions
to
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
subclasses
of
nouns
there
are
lots
of
different
kinds
of
nouns
and
in
spite
of
our
reservations
about
using
meaning
as
a
criterion
to
determine
parts
and
subparts
of
speech
we
will
use
aspects
of
meaning
to
distinguish
the
traditional
subclasses
of
nouns
but
we
will
back
up
the
semantic
distinctions
by
pointing
out
formal
patterns
that
correlate
with
them
in
fact
we
can
only
be
certain
that
meaning
distinctions
really
exist
in
the
language
if
they
correspond
to
distinct
formal
patterns
proper
nouns
as
we
have
seen
are
the
words
that
best
fit
the
traditional
definition
of
a
noun—i.e
a
word
that
names
a
person
place
or
thing
thus
your
personal
name
names
you
though
it
may
also
name
other
people
den
ver
names
the
capital
city
of
colorado
and
colorado
names
the
state
that
den
ver
is
the
capital
of—both
of
which
are
places
and
things
note
that
proper
nouns
are
spelled
with
an
initial
capital
letter
and
if
the
proper
name
consists
of
more
than
one
word
e.g
the
statue
of
liberty
then
all
the
major
words
are
spelled
with
initial
capitals
we
will
deal
with
complex
proper
names
like
this
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
some
texts
may
vary
in
their
treatment
of
nouns
for
example

capitalizes
gay

sometimes
does
not
and
gee

common
nouns
name
classes
of
things
individual
physical
objects
are
the
most
straightforward
instances
of
things
and
the
words
that
name
classes
of
such
things
are
indeed
generally
nouns
e.g
book
names
the
class
of
books
and
hard
drive
names
the
class
of
hard
drives
nouns
that
name
classes
of
physical
things
are
called
concrete
nouns
other
examples
include
sneeze
floor
and
paper
not
all
things
are
physical
some
like
ideas
exist
only
in
our
minds
words
for
classes
of
things
that
exist
only
in
minds
e.g
goodness
truth
beauty
and
reason
are
called
abstract
nouns
abstract
nouns
tend
to
be
non-count

below
and
to
end
in
certain
derivational
suffixes
e.g

the

people
gathered

common
purpose
nouns
that
name
classes
of
collections
are
called
collective
nouns
other
examples
include
army

congress
in
american
english
collective
nouns
normally
take
a
singular
verb
e.g
the
jury
is
out
while
in
british
english
they
take
a
plural
e.g
the
jury
are
out
the
american
variety
some
times
uses
the
plural
to
suggest
lack
of
unity
within
the
group
e.g
the
jury
are
divided
pronoun
substitutes
for
collectives
are
also
normally
singular
in

in

english
an
important
subdivision
of
nouns
particularly
for
people
learning
eng
lish
as
a
second
language
is
between
count
and
non-count
also
called
mass
nouns
some
non-count
nouns
are
thought
of
as

as
if
they
were
undifferentiated

some

denote
substances
made
up
of
small
discrete
particles
and
we
can
speak
of
individual
particles
or
numbers
of
them

remarks
on
the
genitive
case
the
genitive
case
is
typically
indicated
by
the
suffix
’s
e.g
maria
’s
success
the
genitive
expression
modifies
a
following
noun
maria’s
modifies
success
its
spelling
is
generally
written
as
’s
the
book
’s
cover
if
the
expression
it
is
attached
to
is
singular
or
is
an
irregular
plural
the
children
’s
toys
and
ei
ther
just
an
apostrophe
if
the
expression
it’s
attached
to
ends
in
s
the
jones
’
house
though
editorial
practice
varies
on
this
and
some
editors
use
’s
the
jones’s
house
while
the
genitive
is
generally
spelled
as
’s
or
s’
there
are
some
specific
exceptions
several
of
the
personal
pronouns
as
we’ll
see
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
have
genitive
forms
ending
in
s
ours
yours
theirs
note
that
there
is
no
apostrophe
in
the
spelling
of
these
forms
this
is
par
ticularly
noteworthy
in
its
the
genitive
of
it
which
is
frequently
misspelled
as
it’s
this
error
is
due
to
two
factors
first
its
violates
the
general
pattern
of
spelling
the
genitive
with
an
apostrophe
though
it
is
consistent
with
the
sub-pattern
that
pronouns
do
not
include
the
apostrophe
second
its
may
be
confused
with
the
word
it’s
which
is
a
contraction
of
it
is
note
that
whose
without
the
apostrophe
is
the
genitive
of
the
pronoun
who
while
who’s
the
contraction
of
who
is
is
parallel
to
it’s
like
the
regular
plural
s
the
genitive
has
three
allomorphs
s
after
voiceless
segments
dick’s
z
after
voiced
segments
toni’s
tom’s
and
z
or
iz
after
sibilants
francis’s
the
genitive
is
often
referred
to
as
the
possessive
case
however
the
geni
tive
denotes
far
more
than
just
possession
for
example
bill’s
in
bill’s
tv
show
is
in
the
genitive
but
besides
possessing
the
tv
show
bill
might
also
have
been
its
producer
director
star
gaffer
key-grip
fan
or
occasional
viewer
to
avoid
too
narrowly
characterizing
the
meaning
of
the
genitive
we
prefer
this
term
to
possessive
exercise
briefly
discuss
the
possible
meaning
relations
between
the
genitive
ex
pression
and
the
noun
it
modifies
in
a
the
candidate’s
advisors
b
the
book’s
author
c
andy’s

159
the
major
parts
of
speech
the
genitive
case
has
generally
been
regarded
as
an
inflection
suffixed
to
nouns
and
pronouns
and
while
it
is
true
that
pronouns
may
take
the
genitive
inflection
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
noun
phrases
not
nouns
may
take
it
note
where
the
genitive
inflection
is
attached
in
oscar
’s
plays
humpty
dumpty
’s
fall
the
kid
’s
skateboard
the
kid
next
door
’s
dog
the
guy
you
broke
up
with
’s
car
unlike
the
plural
inflection
which
is
suffixed
to
the
head
noun
of
an
np
the
genitive
inflection
is
suffixed
to
the
end
of
the
np
although
s-genitives
occur
on
nearly
all
noun
phrases
sometimes
the
alternative
of-phrase
sounds
stylistically
more
natural
cf
the
cause
of
the
accident
vs
the
accident’s
cause
in
english
the
inflected
genitive
is
most
comfortable
with
animate
entities
verbs
verbs
can
be
subdivided
into
main
and
auxiliary
verbs
we
will
treat
the
various
types
of
auxiliaries
such
as
may
might
and
should
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
and
will
concentrate
here
on
main
verbs
i.e
those
which
may
occur
alone
in
a
clause
t
raditional
grammars
define
verbs
seman
tically
e.g
as
words
that
represent
activities
grow
kiss
freeze
run
and
states
of
being
be
have
resemble
states
are
unchanging
situations
while
activities
are
situations
in
which
change
occurs
activity
verbs
are
also
called
dynamic
verbs
though
the
terminology
is
far
from
consistent
state
verbs
typically
have
to
do
with
existence
and
static
relationships
just
as
nouns
denote
classes
of
entities
and
stuff
verbs
denote
classes
of
states
and
activities
as
with
most
meaning-based
definitions
this
one
is
a
tad
simplistic
for
instance
nouns
derived
from
verbs
through
zero
derivation
e.g
strike
kick
throw
maintain
their
sense
of
action
as
nouns
derived
from
verbs
by
derivational
affixing
do
e.g
action
likewise
verbs
derived
from
nouns—e.g
pot
as
in
to
pot
plants
may
appear
to
retain
some
of
the
entity-naming
sense
they
had
as
nouns
in
addition
students
occasionally
classify
certain
adjectives
as
verbs
especially
those
adjectives
that
suggest
activity
e.g
vigorous
playful
cruel
and
we’ve
had
a
student
who
classi
fied
the
preposition
as
as
a
verb
because
it
denoted
a
relationship
as
verbs
often
do
additionally
adjectives
and
other
types
of
expressions
may
name
states
cf
to
sleep
and
asleep
nonetheless
the
semantic
division
of
verbs
is
a
good
place
to
start
our
discussion
though
we’ll
refine
the
activity/state
division
in
the
exercises
in
this
section
as
we
noted
in
our
discussion
of
nouns
it
is
important
to
correlate
a
se
mantic
distinction
with
distinct
formal
patterns
the
distinction
between
ac
tivity
and
state
verbs
correlates
with
whether
or
not
a
verb
can
occur
in
the
progressive
aspect
activity
verbs
can
oscar

state
verbs
are
particularly
common
in
academic
writing
confirm
this
by
examining
a
selection
of
texts
from
that
genre
why
do
you
think
state
verbs
are
so
common
in
this
genre
we
saw
that
nouns
may
shift
between
subcategories
so
it
should
be
no
surprise
to
find
verbs
shifting
between
the
state
and
activity
subcategories
for
example
be
is
a
state
verb
in
oscar
is
weird
but
an
action
verb
in
oscar
is
being
weird
as
its
occurrence
in
the
progressive
shows
the
former
sentence
means
that
oscar
is
generally
or
characteristically
weird
the
latter
means
that
he
is
acting
weird

we
can

to

the
distinction
between
permanent
and
temporary
characteristics
is
an
important
one
compare
tigers
are
fierce
with
tigers
are
tired
the
former
sentence
is
grammatical
and
unremarkable
it
represents
a
gen
eral
characteristic
of
the
class
of
tigers
the
latter
sentence
is
odd
in
that
it
seems
to
attribute
a
characteristic
we
would
normally
assume
to
be
temporary
as
if
it
were
a
permanent
characteristic
of
tigers
in
gen
eral
the
permanent/temporary
distinction
is
exploited
in
dictionaries
look
up
tiger
and
four
other
words
in
a
dictionary
and
discuss
how
this
distinction
is
reflected
in
how
they
are
defined

individual

may
have
more
than
one
meaning
con
sequently
we
might
expect
one
meaning
of
a
verb
to
represent
an
activ
ity
and
another
meaning
of
the
verb
to
represent
a
state
smell

verb
the
sentence
john
is
smelling
the
roses
is
grammatical
in
the
progressive
161
the
major
parts
of

therefore
has
an
activity
interpretation

*
the
roses
are
smell
ing
musty
which
is
progressive
but
ungrammatical
from
data
like
this
we
must
conclude
that
smell
also
allows
a
state
interpretation
there
are
many
more
subclasses
of

a
distinction
related
to
change
of
state
is
between
telic
and
atelic
verbs
telic
verbs
represent
events
that
have
a
natural
end
point
the
accomplishment
of
some
purpose
or
a
change
of
state
e.g
make
evaporate
these
are
also
called
accomplishment
or
resultative
verbs
once
something
is
made
or
has
evaporated
the
making
and
evaporating
processes
must
stop
for
that
thing
as
with
change
of
state
verbs
telic
verbs
in
the
progressive
represent
processes
before
their
completion
the
water
is
evaporating
implies
that
the
water
has
not
yet
fully
evaporated
atelic
verbs
represent
events
as
having
no
natural
end-state
or
product
e.g
golf
as
in
the
ceos
are
golfing
a
verb
may
be
telic
on
some
occasions
e.g
the
children
are
playing
a
game
of
delahunty
and
garvey
162chess
but
atelic
on
other
occasions
e.g
the
children
are
playing
for
each
of
the
following
sentences
decide
whether
it
represents
a
telic
or
an
atelic
situation
and
justify
your
decision
a
she
wrote
a
poem
b
she
writes
poetry
c
the
water
froze
d
the
water
is
freezing
e
the

6
the
count
non-count
distinction
in
nouns
is
similar
to
the
telic
atelic
distinction
in
verbs
count
nouns
represent
classes
of
bounded
entities
telic
verbs
represent
classes
of
bounded
situations
non-count
nouns
represent
unbounded
classes
of
things
or
substances
atelic
verbs
represent
unbounded
classes
of
events
thus
a
piece
of
a
chair
is
not
a
chair
but
a
piece
of
paper
is
still
paper
similarly
writing
a
piece
of
a
poem
is
not
the
same
as
writing
a
poem
though
a
piece
of

is
still

conclusions
might
you
derive
about
human
cognition
from
this

nouns
and
verbs

all
the
main
verbs
in
exercise
6
just
above
then
classify
each
main
verb
as
state
or
activity
which
kind
of
verb
predominates
in
that
piece
of
text
can
you
divide
the
text
into
two
sections
each
with
a
different
rhetorical
purpose
do
the
verbs
in
the
two
sections
differ
why
do
you
think
that
might
be
8
we
can
divide
the
category
of
activity
verbs
into
those
that
repre
sent
events
that
take
just
a
point
of
time
punctual
verbs
e.g
tap
and
those
that
take
a
period
of
time
durative
verbs
e.g
read
in
the
progressive
punctual
verbs
strongly
suggest
repeated
action
oscar
is
tapping
his
fingers
impatiently
describes
multiple
finger
taps
but
os
car
is
reading
strongly
suggests
a
single
continuous
episode
of
reading
put
each
of
the
following
verbs
into
the
progressive
then
determine
whether
the
resulting
expression
denotes
multiple
repeated
events
or
a
single
continuous
activity
punch
beat
nap
flap
wink
close
run
work
9
change
of
state
process
verbs
are
yet
another
subclass
of
activity
verb
as
their
name
suggests
they
describe
change
from
one
state
to
another
e.g
melt
if
something
melts
then
it
changes
from
a
solid
to
a
liquid
state
but
notice
how
such
verbs
are
interpreted
when
they

the
major
parts
of

in
the
simple
past
tense
the

melted
describes
the
completed
change
and
in
the
progressive
aspect
the
ice
is/was
melting
describes
the
melting
in
progress
but
not
yet
complete
by
comparing
their
in
terpretations
in
the
past
tense
and
the
progressive
show
that
the

lowing
verbs
are
also
change
of
state
verbs

a
change
of
state
verb
simply
represents
some
entity
as
undergo
ing
or
having
undergone
a
change
from
one
state
to
another
however
sentences
may
also
include
information
on
what
caused
the
change
of
state
compare

thick

the
former
sentence
tells

who
caused
the

to
thicken
the
latter
does
not
let’s
call
clauses
that
include
information
on
the
cause
of
a
change
of
state
action
clauses
and
their
verbs
action
verbs
remember
activity
and
action
verbs
are
different
generally
simple
change
of
state
clauses
are
intransitive
with
the
entity
undergoing
the
change
of
state
represented
as
the
subject
while
action
clauses
are
transitive
with
the
subject
representing
the
cause
of
the
change
of
state
and
the
object
representing
the
entity
changed

formal
characteristics
of
verbs
we
must
first
distinguish
formally
between
main
verbs
and
auxiliary
verbs
the

by
itself
in
a
verb

an

in
this

collapse
is
the
main
verb
it
cannot
be
removed
from
the
sentence
without
producing
an
ungrammatical
result
e.g
*the

verb
will
always
be

in
questions
e.g
will
the

collapse
while
main

cannot

*collapsed

building
just
as
we
did
with
nouns
we
use
formal
analytic
tests
to
determine
which
words
are

potentially
allow
four
inflections
a

normally
occurs
with

there

shows
some
important
properties
of
verb
inflections
first
certain
inflections
sometimes
require
changes
in
the
spelling
of
the
root
e.g
tries
hitting
phonologically
these
words
follow
the
regular
patterns
noted
above
second
for
regular
verbs—e.g
start
clean
try—the
past
tense
and
ven-forms
are
identical
in
sound
and
spelling
irregular
verbs—those
which
for
historical
reasons
differ
from
the
general
pattern—display
a
variety
of
in
flectional
differences
but
almost
exclusively
in
the
ved
and
ven-forms
with
very
few
exceptions
e.g
is
has
does
vs
and
ving
forms
fit
the
general
pat
tern
moreover
some
irregular
verbs
such
as
bring
and
hit
follow
the
same
pattern
as
regular
ones
by
having
identical
ved
and
ven
forms
though
these
are
not
formed
by
adding
ed
besides
varying
among
themselves
in
the
for
mation
of
ved
and
ven
forms
irregular
verbs
sometimes
have
dialect
variants
for
instance
shrink
has
the
alternate
past
shrunk
although
shrank
resembles
the
historically
older
form
of
the
verb
shrunk
reflects
a
pressure
in
modern
english
to
make
irregulars
more
regular
especially
by
making
the
ved
and
ven
forms
identical
indeed
the
archaic
shrunken
is
used
now
only
as
an
ad
jective
e.g
shrunken
head
only
a
few
modern
english
verbs
such
as
broken
and
frozen
actually
still
use
en
for
the
past
participle
form
though
dialects
vary—british
english
uses
mown
as
past
participle
whereas
american
eng
lish
uses
mowed
finally
irregular
verbs
often
have
regional
and
social
variants
that
may
be
stigmatized
particularly
in
academic
settings
students
are
often
unfortunately
and
inaccurately
considered
slow
or
ignorant
if
they
use
dove

and

as

usually
define
nouns
and
verbs
semantically
they
delahunty
and
garvey
172often
shift
to
functional
criteria
to
characterize
adjectives
a
typical
definition
of
adjective
is
a
word
that
modifies
a
noun
or
pronoun
occasionally
you
will
see
adjectives
defined
as
words
that
describe
nouns
which
makes
no
more
sense
than
saying
that
nouns
are
persons
places
and
things
if
adjec
tives
describe
anything
it
is
whatever
the
nouns
they
modify
denote
while
we
might
criticize
the
traditional
definition
for
changing
from
meaning
to
function
it
is
more
appropriate
to
determine
whether
it
leads
to
reasonably
successful
identification
of
adjectives
the
definition
holds
good
in
simple
cases
such
as
old
shoes
offensive
re
mark
and
matters
inconsequential
though
in
the
last
case
students
may
have
trouble
recognizing
the
second
word
rather
than
the
first
as
an
adjective
but
in
each
case
the
adjective
does
modify
a
noun
which
serves
as
the
head
of
the
phrase
however
words
that
are
clearly
not
adjectives
may
modify
nouns
for
instance
stone
in
stone
wall
is
by
formal
criteria
a
noun
and
not
an
adjec
tive
cf
stones
and
stone’s
likewise
the
in
the
wall
shows
none
of
the
formal
characteristics
of
adjectives
though
it
clearly
modifies
the
noun
wall
in
a
nutshell
the
fact
that
a
word
modifies
a
noun
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
call
it
an
adjective
the
traditional
functional
definition
suffers
also
because
it
claims
that
ad
jectives
may
modify
pronouns
clearly
an
adjective
cannot
modify
a
pronoun
in
any
of
the
examples
below

the

suggests—correctly—that
such

of
adjectives
are
really
not
instances
of
modification
at
all
but
rather
of
complementation
any
student
who
tries
to
relate
such
examples
to
clear
cases
of

will
become
befuddled

formal

of

their

adjectives

in
a
very

set

the
two
most
common
are
a
between
a

an

word
and
a

and

after
a

i.e

we
will
discuss
the
words
that
function
as
determiners
in
our
chapter

minor
parts
of

briefly
this

words
such
as

these

we
must
make
a
rather
important
distinction
here
between
gradable
and
non-gradable
adjectives
gradable
adjectives
are
those
that
can
be
inflected
for
comparative
and
superlative
and
modified
by
more

very

words

gradable
adjectives
include

electronic
entire
single
as
you
can
demonstrate
for
yourself
by
trying
to
inflect
or
modify
them
non-gradable
adjectives
may
over
time
become
gradable
and
this
process
may
cause
usage
controversy
as
the
recent
history
of
unique
shows
for
more
on
this
word
we
suggest
that
you
check
unique
in
a
dictionary
preferably
one
such
as
the
american
heritage
which
includes
thoughtful
usage
notes
our
final
test
for
adjectivehood
relies
on
the
fact
that
only
adjectives
can
occur
in
the
frame
as
as
a(n
x
where
x
is
an
appropriate
noun
for
example
in
as
fearless
as
a
lion
fearless
is
in
the
test
position
and
lion
is
a
noun
filling
the
x
position
because
the
expression
is
grammatical
we
can
infer
that
fearless
may
be
an
adjective

any

of

a

used
to
modify
a

an
ad

or
another

this
definition
is
clearly
functional
and
actually
represents

of

here
the
adverb
frankly
indicates
that
the
speaker
feels
he
or
she
is
being
candid
in
uttering
the
sentence
and
as
we
have
now
grown
to
expect
from
functional
definitions
the
traditional
definition
of
adverb
will
predict
false
positives
i.e
predict
that
certain
words
or
expressions
are
adverbs
when
they
are
not
for
instance
compare
cautiously
with
with
caution
in
the
officer
approached
the
motorist
cautiously/with
caution
both
expressions
function
identically—both
tell
us
the
manner
in
which
the
officer
approached
the
motorist
i.e
both
mod
ify
the
verb
approached
however
while
cautiously
is
definitely
an
adverb
with
caution
is
just
as
definitely
a
prepositional
phrase
we
will
formally
distinguish
true
adverbs
from
other
phrases
that
can
fulfill
some
of
the
same
functions
as
adverbs
but
we
will
refer
to
all
expressions
that
function
like
adverbs
with
the
cover-term
adverbial
our
approach
as
usual
will
be
to
begin
with
a
formal
characterization
of
adverbs
we
will
then
return
for
a
brief
review
of
the
functional
division
of
adverbs
according
to
what
they
modify—sentences
verbs
verb
phrases
adjectives
and
adverbs
finally
we
will
indicate
some
of
the
traditional

mantic
categories

formal
characteristics
of

many
adverbs
cannot
be
inflected

those
that
can
are

we
can
minimally
adapt
the

appendix
to
major
parts
of
speech
prototypes
perhaps
the
greatest
frustration
for
students—and
teachers—of
grammar
is
the
discovery
that
seemingly
clear
and
airtight
definitions
and
tests
fail
to
work
smoothly
in
all
cases
we
argued
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
that
one
source
of
this
difficulty
is
the
faulty
status
of
definitions
for
instance
those
that
determine
parts
of
speech
on
the
basis
of
their
meanings
or
functions
our
system
augments
such
definitions
with
a
set
of
formal
conditions
pertaining
to
morphological
inflectional
and
derivational
and
syntactic
positional
characteristics
of
words
as
some
of
our
exercises
dem
onstrate
not
all
conditions
will
apply
in
all
cases
for
instance
the
condi
tion
that
nouns
can
be
made
plural
might
seem
to
exclude
many
words
that
are
clearly
nouns
by
other
criteria
e.g
cattle
and
furniture
on
the
other
hand
these
words
can
accept
the
genitive
as
in
the
cattle’s
thirst
and
the
furniture’s
delivery
additionally
the
ure
morpheme
on
furniture
is
typical
to
nouns
armature
ligature
caricature
and
signature
though
other
words
besides
nouns
may
appear
to
end
in
the
ure
morpheme
mature
adjective
or
verb
and
insure
verb
in
other
words
we
seem
to
find
cases
where
our
delahunty
and
garvey
188conditions
a
fail
to
apply
to
all
members
of
a
parts-of-speech
class
and
b
seem
to
apply
to
words
outside
the
class
that
the
conditions
are
chosen
to
identify
t
wo
natural
reactions
to
this
situation
are
possible
one
response
would
simply
be
to
ignore
the
anomalies
and
present
the
conditions
as
absolutes
this
approach
requires
that
conditions
be
both
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
are
necessary
if
they
all
have
to
apply
they
are
sufficient
if
no
other
conditions
are
needed
this
approach
has
the
serious
disadvantage
of
colliding
head-on
with
reality
a
second
response
would
give
up
the
entire
enterprise
of
defining
parts
of
speech
as
too
haphazard
to
be
worth
doing
but
if
we
adopt
this
course
of
action
we
will
never
learn
anything
about
language
and
our
students
will
wrongly
assume
that
it
is
utterly
chaotic
as
you
might
suspect
we
view
both
of
these
extreme
positions
as
funda
mentally
wrong—wrong
about
the
nature
of
language
and
wrong
about
the
way
in
which
language
should
be
studied
let
us
now
examine
why
let’s
begin
with
two
exercises
or
party
games
if
you
prefer
first
ask
a
group
of
your
friends
to
make
a
list
of
ten
birds
if
you
tally
your
lists
of
birds
you
will
find
that
certain
names
appear
early
on
many
lists
e.g
eagle
robin
sparrow
while
others
appear
later
e.g
owl
crow
also
some
names
will
appear
on
almost
all
lists
while
others
e.g
chicken
penguin
ostrich
will
appear
less
frequently
or
not
at
all
the
next
step
is
to
ask
your
subjects
why
they
made
their
choices
they
will
probably
say
that
birds
have
feathers
lay
eggs
and
are
able
to
fly
and
in
the
clearest
cases
all
these
conditions
apply
however
in
less
clear
cases
some
but
not
all
of
the
conditions
apply
or
the
conditions
conflict
for
ex
ample
robins
have
feathers
fly
and
lay
eggs
while
chickens
typically
do
not
fly
or
at
least
do
not
fly
very
far
penguins
and
ostriches
do
not
fly
at
all
while
our
experiment
tells
us
about
how
we
categorize
actual
birds
it
also
tells
us
about
how
we
use
the
word
bird
when
we
use
an
expression
like
bird
we
group
together
objects
not
so
much
on
the
basis
of
a
rigid
set
of
characteristics
but
on
a
set
of
criteria
or
conditions
that
we
use
flexibly
in
this
way
we
group
together
objects
on
the
basis
of
what
the
philosopher
ludwig
wittgenstein
called
family
resemblances
you
might
envision
then
a
target
with
some
objects
close
to
the
bull’s
eye—those
entities
that
are
clearly
birds
those
entities
that
fall
closest
to
the
center
of
the
target
are
called
prototypes
they
possess
all
of
the
features
typical
of
the
category
toward
the
periphery
of
the
target
lie
entities
that
are
less
birdy
according
to
how
many
of
the
conditions
they
meet
in
language
also
the
boundaries
between
classes
of
words
may
be
fuzzy
that
is
just
as
we
may
occasionally
189
the
major
parts
of
speechhave
trouble
deciding
whether
to
call
a
particular
creature
a
bird
e.g
is
archaeopteryx
a
bird
we
may
also
have
difficulty
deciding
whether
a
word
is
a
noun
or
an
adjective
e.g
poor
see
figure
5.1
in
aitchison
2003
56
of
course
not
all
conditions
are
of
equal
importance
some
are
essen
tial
their
lack
disqualifies
something
as
being
an
instance
of
a
category
for
instance
a
bird
must
lay
eggs
rather
than
produce
live
young
at
the
other
extreme
some
conditions
are
excluded
they
must
not
be
present
a
bird
cannot
have
four
legs
between
these
extremes
lie
other
conditions
ex
pected
conditions
are
associated
with
normal
or
typical
characteristics
such
as
flight
for
birds
creatures
that
lack
an
expected
feature—e.g
penguins
which
cannot
fly—may
serve
to
make
the
object
an
atypical
or
defective
member
of
its
class
without
disqualifying
it
from
membership
altogether
some
conditions
are
merely
possible
they
result
from
common
associa
tions
of
the
object
for
example
birds
commonly
eat
worms
yet
one
would
hardly
be
surprised
at
a
bird
that
ate
only
seeds
finally
certain
conditions
are
unlikely
though
not
strictly
impossible
a
1000-pound
animal
that
met
all
the
essential
bird
criteria
might
strain
the
imagination
but
we
would
probably
be
willing
to
categorize
it
as
a
bird
cruse
1986
we
thus
seem
to
identify
objects
on
the
basis
of
their
resemblance
to
certain
prototypes—an
object
which
we
consider
the
most
typical
member
of
the
category
in
other
words
prototypes
share
all
of
the
necessary
and
expected
conditions
perhaps
some
of
the
possible
ones
and
none
of
the
excluded
or
unlikely
ones
how
does
the
notion
of
prototypes
relate
to
grammar
well
labels
such
as
noun
and
verb
have
much
the
same
status
as
bird
we
can
state
a
set
of
conditions—inflectional
derivational
and
syntactic—that
allow
us
to
classify
words
in
a
relatively
consistent
and
logical
fashion
however
cases
arise
when
not
all
of
the
conditions
apply
that
is
certain
nouns
may
be
less
nouny
than
others
nevertheless
nouns
demonstrate
a
family
resemblance
to
one
another
because
they
share
many
characteristics
of
course
you
can
expect
to
encounter
words
that
cause
difficulties
since
the
borders
of
the
noun
category
are
fuzzy
for
instance
consider
the
following
words
that
end
in
ing
interest
ing
meeting
sing
singing
let
us
consider
the
condition
of
taking
the
plural
morpheme
along
with
the
related
feature
of
appearing
in
the
noun
slot
two
we
can
thus
immediately
eliminate
interesting
*two
interestings
and
perhaps
sing
two
sings
unless
we
are
native
americans
we
can
immediately
qualify
meeting
as
a
noun
two
meetings
singing
raises
some
problems
is
two
singings
grammatical
speakers
will
vary
in
how
they
answer
this
question
indicating
that
the
expression
lies
on
the
border
of
the
noun
category
note
however
that
the
variation
has
no
impact
on
the
force
of
the
conditions
even
delahunty
and
garvey
190someone
who
accepts
the
phrase
as
grammatical
will
readily
agree
that
it
is
not
a
typical
use
of
the
word
singing
thus
we
might
conclude
that
the
capacity
to
be
made
plural
is
an
expected—though
not
essential—condition
for
nouns
you
might
object
that
the
notion
of
prototypes
leads
to
linguistic
anar
chy
perhaps
there
are
no
essential
conditions
moreover
if
standards
are
flexible
aren’t
we
in
danger
of
measuring
with
a
rubber
ruler
this
reaction
however
initially
reasonable
has
no
real
justification
in
fact
our
position
allows
the
maintenance
of
analytic
standards
without
reducing
grammar
either
to
legalistic
rigidity
or
anarchic
mush
for
one
thing
english
itself
is
grammatically
flexible
the
prevalence
of
conversion
from
one
part
of
speech
to
another
with
no
formal
change
provides
one
clear
example
english
allows
almost
any
word
to
be
converted
to
another
part
of
speech
at
least
in
restricted
contexts
as
the
following
sug
gest
1
a
ifs
ands
or
buts
subordinating
and
coordinating
conjunc
tions
to
nouns
b
whys
and
wherefores
interrogatives
to
nouns
c
but
me
no
buts
coordinator
to
verb
and
noun
what
we
see
here
are
instances
of
linguistic
creativity
the
ability
to
make
infinite
use
of
finite
linguistic
resources
which
as
we’ve
seen
is
characteristic
of
all
languages
clearly
the
concepts
we
use
to
describe
language
should
be
able
to
account
for
the
linguistic
characteristics
we
actually
observe
categories
arranged
around
prototypes
and
which
allow
fuzzy
boundaries
allow
us
to
do
this
such
categories
do
not
require
that
we
abandon
our
standards
of
linguistic
usage
rather
they
should
encour
age
us
to
study
and
understand
the
language
as
it
is
used
not
merely
judge
it
on
the
basis
of
simplistic
a
priori
assumptions
lest
this
sound
too
abstract
let’s
consider
some
practical
consequences
of
the
fact
that
not
all
criteria
apply
to
every
word
in
a
class
one
consequence
is
that
we
must
accept
that
all
major
classes
of
words
consist
of
subclasses
of
those
words
e.g
those
nouns
that
cannot
be
made
plural
e.g
information
independence
some
of
the
nouns
that
cannot
be
made
plural
constitute
the
subclass
of
non-count
mass
nouns
though
there
are
many
other
subclasses
of
nouns
of
which
we’ve
seen
a
few
teachers
should
be
knowledgeable
about
the
most
important
subclasses
of
words
and
their
linguistic
proper
ties
e.g
count
and
non-count
nouns
transitive
and
intransitive
verbs
and
so
on
and
be
able
to
accurately
present
them
to
their
students
especially
to
those
students
whose
first
language
is
not
english
191
the

a
second
consequence
of
prototypes
is
that
they
allow
us
to
see
similari
ties
between
classes
of
words
for
instance
they
encourage
us
to
ask
ques
tions
such
as
how
is
a
noun
like
a
verb
this
question
may
seem
like
a
riddle
but
if
we
consider
the
two
subclasses
of
verbs—transitive
and
intransitive
on
the
formal
basis
that
the
former
but
not
the
latter
may
take
an
object
as
in
2a,b
2
a
the
broncos
defeated
the
jets
b
the
rabbit
disappeared
in
2a
defeat
is
inflected
for
past
tense
and
so
is
clearly
a
verb
and
because
it
is
followed
by
the
direct
object
the
jets
it
is
transitive
in
2b
disappeared
is
likewise
a
verb
but
it
is
intransitive
since
it
cannot
be
followed
by
a
direct
object
as
3a,b
show
3
a
*the
rabbit
disappeared
itself
i.e
made
itself
disappear
b
*the
magician
disappeared
the
rabbit
corresponding
to
the
verbs
in
2
are
nouns
that
resemble
them
4
a
the
broncos’
defeat
of
the
jets
b
the
rabbit’s
disappearance
note
that
example
4a
contains
the
noun
defeat
it
can
be
made
plural
which
has
been
converted
from
a
verb
and
which
is
modified
by
the
geni
tive
phrase
the
broncos’
which
corresponds
to
the
subject
of
the
verb
defeat
in
2a
while
the
prepositional
phrase
of
the
jets
corresponds
to
the
direct
object
the
jets
in
2a
likewise
the
derived
noun
disappearance
in
4b
cor
responds
to
the
verb
disappear
in
2b
however
just
as
the
verb
disappear
cannot
accept
an
object
the
noun
disappearance
cannot
take
an
of-phrase
complement
corresponding
to
a
direct
object
as
shown
by
the
ungrammati
cality
of
5a,b
compare
to
3a,b
5
a
*the
rabbit’s
disappearance
of
itself
b
*the
magician’s
disappearance
of
the
rabbit
in
other
words
certain
nouns
have
restrictions
that
closely
parallel
those
of
transitivity
on
verbs
the
facts
of
english
grammar
thus
suggest
that
the
rigid
separation
of
parts
of
speech
conceals
a
potentially
rich
network
of
similarities
among
delahunty
and
garvey

similarities
that
might
prove
interesting
for
teachers

writing

than
ignore

more
important
is
the

with

our
approach
in
the
previous
chapter
used
formal
criteria
to
try
to
arrive
at
consistent
assignments
of
words
to
parts
of
speech
our
approach
in
this
chapter
will
be
similar
the
minor
word
classes
are
often
referred
to
as
closed
classes
this
is
because
they
have
relatively
few
members
which
are
added
to
only
occa
sionally
as
a
result
some
of
the
minor
form
classes
can
be
defined
simply
by
listing
their
members
we
will
distinguish
about
a
dozen
of
these
classes
but
the
largest
of
them
the
prepositions
has
only
about
50
members
na
tive
english-speaking
students
do
not
need
to
memorize
the
members
of
these
classes
they
can
become
as
consciously
familiar
as
they
need
to
be
with
them
through
presentation
and
practice
some
memorization
may
help
some
non-native
english
speaking
students
but
again
proper
presentation
and
lots
of
practice
should
enable
them
to
develop
control
over
these
words
minor

classes
have
several
properties
in
common
first
they
tend
not
to
alter
the
basic
content
of
a
sentence
for
this
reason
they
have
some
times
been
called
function
or
grammatical
words
in
contrast
to
the
major
parts
of
speech
called
content
words
content

in

members

194bers
of

all
of
the
50
most
common
words
in
english
are
function
words
they
account
for
about
60%
of
words
used
in
speech
and
45%
of
those
used
in
writing
you
can
check
this
for
yourself
by
count
ing
the
words
in
this
paragraph
then
counting
the
words
belonging
to
the
major
parts
of
speech
and
subtracting
that
number
from
the
whole
the
remainder
is
the
number
of
words
belonging
to
the
minor

of

though
sometimes
used
to
dramatize
the
sorry
state
of
english
this
statistic
is
as
true
of
henry
james’
prose
as
of
the
most
pedestrian
discourse
this
is
because
the
minor
words
are
essential
for
indicating
important
modifica
tions
to
and
relations
among
the
content
words
regardless
of
whether
the
content
words
were
chosen
by
the
brilliant
or
the
dull
because
they
are
important
for
integrating
content
words
into
the
structural
organization
of
sentences
minor
class
words
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
structure
words
in
presenting
the
minor
word
classes
we
will
proceed
mainly
by
list
ing
some
or
all
of
their
members
we
will
also
note
semantic
functional
and
formal
characteristics
except
for
pronouns
the
formal
properties
of
these
items
do
not
in
english
include
inflectional
or
derivational
marking
rather
they
emerge
from
the
item’s
ability
to
combine
with
other
words
phrases
or
sentences
for
instance
after
is
a
preposition
because
it
can
com
bine
with
a
noun
phrase
bolded
as
in
after
the
announcement
the
com
bination
of
a
preposition
and
its
following
noun
phrase
is
called
a
prepo
sitional
phrase
we
will
examine
this
and
other
phrases
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
since
minor
class
members
may
enter
into
several
different
types
of
combination
they
will
sometimes
like
content
words
be
members
of
more
than
one
class
for
example
when
after
is
followed
by
a
clause
as
in
after
the
announcement
appeared
we
received
many
phone
calls
it
is
traditionally
thought
of
as
a
subordinating
adverbial
conjunction
pronouns
the
traditional
definition
of
pronoun
is
a
word
used
in
place
of
one
or
more
nouns
let’s
test
the
adequacy
of
this
definition
by
examining
some
examples
1
a
jonathan
felt
sorry
for
jeremy
so
he
repaired
his
bike
for
him
b
because
he
wanted
to
sell
it
jonathan
repaired
his
bike
c
jonathan
repaired
his
bike
the
traditional
definition
is
a
formal
one
you
can
easily
test
it
by
replacing
each
one
of
the
pronouns
with
either
of
the
nouns
jonathan
or
jeremy
in
1a-c
while
the
replacement
definition
of
pronouns
seems
to
work
well
enough
195
the
minor
parts
of

ask
yourself
what
their

sentence
2
2
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
elected
juan
as
their
representative
clearly
if
it
replaces
anything
it
replaces
a
version
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
which
is
very
definitely
not
a
noun
or
mere
list
of
nouns
in
fact
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
is
a
noun
phrase
a
group
of
words
that
has
a
noun
in
this
case
members
as
its
head
word
sentences
like
2
and
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
them
show
that
the
standard
definition
of
a
pronoun
must
be
amended
at
least
to
read
a
noun
or
noun
phrase
but
even
this
reformulation
is
not
accurate
if
we
replace
the
noun
members
in
sentence
2
with
a
pronoun
it
becomes
ungrammatical

*all
of
the
them
of
the
class
elected
juan
as
their

a
pronoun
replaces
a
noun
only
when
that
noun
is
the
only
word
and
there
fore
the
head
in
its
phrase
we
must
conclude
that
pronouns
always
replace
entire
noun
phrases
for
the
moment
let’s
define
a
pronoun
as
a
word
that
replaces
a
noun
phrase
any
discussion
of
pronouns
must
address
the
issue
of
how
we
decide
what
a
particular
pronoun
refers
to
in
a
specific
sentence
for
example
one
very
likely
interpretation
of
1c
is
jonathan
repaired
jonathan’s
bike
on
this
inter
pretation
his
is
assumed
to
refer
to
whoever
jonathan
refers
to
presumably
jonathan
because
a
pronoun
and
its
antecedent
refer
to
the
same
entity
in
the
discourse
world
they
are
said
to
co-refer
so
the
noun
phrase
jonathan
is
used
to
determine
the
referent
of
his
a
noun
phrase
that
determines
the
ref
erent
of
a
pronoun
is
said
to
be
that
pronoun’s
antecedent
this
term
used
to
mean
going
before
and
in
most
cases
a
pronoun’s
antecedent
does
precede
the
pronoun
though
sentence
1b
shows
that
an
antecedent
can
sometimes
follow
its
pronoun
however
sentences
1a-c
are
systematically
ambiguous
they
can
mean
either
1d-f
or
1g-i
respectively

that
is
what
a
pronoun
refers
to
is
not
always
determined
by
another
noun
phrase
in
its
sentence
rather
what
a
pronoun
refers
to
may
be
determined
by
the
situational
context
in
which
the
language
is
used
as
is
typically
the
case
in
spoken
interaction
we’d
like
you
to
notice
now
that
pronouns
are
typically
shorter
and
communicate
far
less
information
than
their
antecedents
for
example
their
in
2
provides
only
the
information
that
more
than
one
entity
is
being
referred
to
along
with
the
grammatical
information
that
their
is
in
the
genitive
case
clearly
far
less
information
than
its
antecedent
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
provides
using
pronouns
instead
of
full
noun
phrases
avoids
repetition
and
reduces
the
production
demands
on
the
speaker
or
writer
and
processing
demands
on
hearers
or
readers
however
because
pronouns
provide
so
little
information
hearers/readers
expect
that
speakers/writers
will
use
them
only
when
it
is
easy
to
determine
what
they
refer
to
if
a
pronoun’s
referent
is
not
easily
or
unambiguously
de
termined
hearers/readers
may
quickly
give
up
trying
to
interpret
the
piece
of
discourse
in
which
it
occurs
in
face-to
face
communication
the
hearer
can
simply
ask
the
speaker
to
clarify
an
unclear
reference
but
in
written
communication
this
is
typically
not
possible
because
confusion
in
spoken
language
can
be
fairly
readily
clarified
it
tends
to
have
more
pronouns
than
written
language
beginning
writers
and
sometimes
even
more
advanced
ones
often
use
pronoun
patterns
typical
of
spoken
language
and
so
must
be
taught
to
ensure
that
the
antecedents/referents
of
their
pronouns
will
be
clear
to
a
reader
who
cannot
ask
for
clarification
in
english
pronouns
and
their
antecedents
must
have
the
same
person
number
and
gender
that
is
pronouns
must
agree
with
their
antecedents
on
these
grammatical
categories
all
of
the
sentences
in

illustrate
agreement

are
each

thus

we
think
not
we
think
that
definitions
of
pronouns
that
regard
them
as
replacements
for
other
expressions
are
fundamentally
flawed
we
prefer
a
more
general
definition
a
pronoun
is
a
minimal
linguistic
form
which
refers
to
speaker(s
addressee(s
and
other(s
and
provides
such
grammatical
information
as
person
number
gender
case
and
humanness
these
minimal
forms
reduce
the
effort
required
in
speaking
and
writing
by
eliminating
the
need
to
repeat
longer
expressions
when
we
wish
to
refer
to
someone
or
something
more
than
once
for
second
and
subsequent
refer
ences
we
select
just
enough
information
to
allow
our
audience
to
keep
track
of
what
we’re
speaking
or
writing
about
if
we
choose
to
use
pronouns
because
the
information
they
communicate
is
so
minimal
we
must
use
them
only
when
the
information
they
communicate
is
sufficient
to
allow
an
audience
to
easily
figure
out
what
they
refer
to
either
from
the
co-text
or
from
the
situational
context
the
grammatical
agreement
expected
between
a
pronoun
and
its

is

for
making
the

masculine

come
in
three
different
forms
he
him
his
she
her
hers
these
different
forms
are
said
to
represent
different
cases
of
the
pronouns
which
case
of
a
pronoun
to
use
depends
upon
the
relation
of
that
word
to
other
parts
of
the
sentence
we
use
he
and
she
when
the
pronoun
is
the
subject
of
a
sentence
him
and
her
if
it
is
the
object
of
a
verb
or
a
preposition
and
his
and
her
if
the
pronoun
modifies
a
noun
we
will
use
the
traditional
names
to
refer
to
these
cases
he/she
are
in
the
nomi
native
case
him/her
are
in
the
objective
a.k.a
accusative
case
and
his/her
are
in
the
genitive
english
also
differentiates
other
pronouns
according
to
case
thus
i
you
we
they
are
all
nominative
me
you
us

all
objective
and
my

you
will
no
doubt
have
noticed
that
there
are
two
genitive
forms
of
cer
tain
pronouns
such
as
my
and
mine
the
forms
corresponding
to
my
your
our
their
are
used
when
they
directly
modify
a
noun
otherwise
we
use
the
other
genitive
forms
that
is
my
horse
as
opposed
to
that
horse
is
mine
the
former
are
sometimes
misleadingly
referred
to
as
possessive
adjectives
as
they
occur
before
the
nouns
they
modify
in
the
positions
believed
wrongly
to
be
typical
of
attributive
adjectives
the
latter
are
often
distinguished
as
possessive
pronouns
because
they
appear
to
replace
possessive
nouns
or
noun
phrases
e.g
compare
that
bike
is
hers
with
that
bike
is
kelly’s
english
nouns
functioning
as
heads
of
subjects
do
not
differ
in
form
from
nouns
functioning
as
heads
of
objects
so
we
do
not
distinguish
between
nominative
and
objective
cases
in
those
instances
grammarians
occasion
ally
refer
to
the
nominative/objective
form
of
nouns
as
the
common
case
earlier
forms
of
english
the
classical
languages
latin
and
greek
and
modern
languages
such
as
finnish
have
much
more
elaborate

traditional

names
and

many
languages
require
case

for

makes

on

and

gender
of
personal
pronouns
the
pronoun
system
of
english
distinguishes
three
genders
masculine
forms
of
he
feminine
forms
of
she
and
neuter
not
neutral
forms
of
it
distinguished
primarily
according
to
the
nature
of
the
objects
they
refer
to
masculine
pronouns
refer
to
males
primarily
human
males
feminine
pronouns
refer
to
females
primarily
human
females
and
neuter
pronouns
refer
either
to
non-human
animals
or
to
entities
that
are
non-animate
and
consequently
are
not
differentiated
according
to
sex
infants
whose
sex
is
201
the
minor
parts
of
speechunknown
are
also
occasionally
referred
to
by
neuter
pronouns
a
system
in
which
the
gender
of
a
word
depends
upon
characteristics
of
its
referent
is
called
a
natural
gender
system
other
languages
such
as
french
german
italian
spanish
and
gaelic
have
grammatical
gender
systems
the
choice
of
gender
is
not
dependent
upon
characteristics
of
a
word’s
referent
rather
words
may
be
assigned
to
gender
classes
often
according
to
formal
linguistic
criteria
in
italian
and
spanish
for
example
words
ending
in
a
are
typically
feminine
in
ger
man
words
ending
in
chen
are
typically
neuter
however
many
nouns
in
these
languages
are
assigned
to
gender
classes
somewhat
arbitrarily
and
so
when
learning
a
noun
one
must
also
learn
its
gender
also
in
these
lan
guages
the
gender
system
is
reflected
not
only
in
the
pronouns
and
nouns
but
in
adjectives
and
articles
too
in
spanish
a
noun
and
any
article
or
adjective
modifying
it
must
agree
in
gender
if
the
noun
is
masculine
then
any
associated
article
or
adjective
must
be
masculine
e.g
el
libro
blanco
lit
the
book
white
the
white
book
if
the
noun
is
feminine
its
modi
fiers
must
also
be
feminine
e.g
la
casa
blanca
lit
the
house
white
the
white
house
in
recent
years
the
english
gender
system
has
given
rise
to
much
discus
sion
of
the
issue
of
sexism
in
language
and
the
need
to
develop
forms
that
are
sex-neutral
standard
written
english
makes
it
difficult
not
to
refer
to
the
sex
of
a
human
referent
when
choosing
a
personal
pronoun
regardless
of
whether
the
person’s
sex
is
relevant
or
even
known
or
knowable
for
ex
ample
compare
the
sentences
every
doctor
works
hard
for
her
patients
and
every
doctor
works
hard
for
his
patients
the
first
suggests
that
all
doctors
are
women
the
second
that
they
are
all
men
clearly
neither
need
be
true
t
raditional
prescriptive
grammars
have
required
that
the
pronoun
after
quantifiers
such
as
every
and
some
be
masculine—and
in
general
that
the
generic
pronoun
be
the
masculine
one
many
people
find
this
norm
to
be
objectionable
and
would
like
to
find
expressions
that
would
not
give
any
indication
of
the
referent’s
sex
for
use
in
situations
where
sex
is
irrelevant
many
writers
now
use
forms
of
they
when
a
generic
pronoun
is
required

someone

articles

would

some

while
the
two
traditional
articles
are
easily
recognized
their
meaning
is
quite
complex
they
are
part
of
a
system
of
devices
that
enable
com
municators
to
introduce
people
and
things
into
a
discourse
and
then
keep
track
of
them
as
the
discourse
continues
other
devices
in
this
system
are
pronouns
and
demonstratives
and
the
distinction
between
common
and
proper
nouns
somewhat
simplistically
the
system
works
as
follows
indefinite
articles
signal
the
entry
of
a
new
entity
into
the
discourse
e.g
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
big
bad
wolf
once
an
entity
has
been
introduced
it
can
be
referred
to
by
an
appropriate
personal
pronoun
e.g
he
lived
all
alone
or
it
can
be
assigned
a
proper
name
e.g
he
was
called
edgar
which
can
209
the
minor
parts
of
speechthen
be
used
to
refer
to
it
e.g
one
day
edgar
was
out
looking
for
his
next
meal
later
references
may
be
marked
by
a
definite
article
e.g
when
the
wolf
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
spotted
some
children
when
we
want
to
distinguish
one
entity
from
another
of
the
same
kind
we
can
use
the
demonstratives
e.g
edgar
said
to
himself
this
child
looks
far
tastier
than
that
one
using
the
plural
forms
of
the
demonstratives
we
can
of
course
distinguish
multiple
entities
e.g
but
those
children
look
tastiest
of
all
the
definite
article
the
demonstratives
the
personal
pronouns
and
proper
nouns
all
signal
definiteness
one
major
purpose
of
marking
a
noun
phrase
as
definite
is
to
indicate
the
speaker’s/writer’s
assumption
that
the
intended
hearer/reader
can
readily
identify
what
it
refers
to
the
general
pattern
is
that
we
provide
our
audiences
with
only
as
much
information
as
we
think
they
will
need
to
identify
what
an
np
refers
to
we
thereby
minimize
repetition
and
the
amount
of
effort
we
must
expend
in
producing
our
utterances
and
the
amount
of
effort
we
require
the
audience
to
expend
in
interpreting
them
and
we
can
rank
the
definite
expressions
according
to
the
amount
of
information
they
provide
nps
with
demonstratives
pro
vide
more
information
than
nps
with
definite
articles
which
provide
more
information
than
proper
names
which
provide
more
information
than
pro
nouns
another
reason
for
making
a
noun
phrase
definite
is
to
indicate
that
all
the
entities
relevant
in
a
situation
are
being
referred
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
there
are
books
strewn
on
a
desk
if
we
say
the
books
should
be
put
back
on
the
shelves
we
will
be
understood
to
mean
all
the
books
not
just
some
of
them
if
we
want
just
some
of
the
books
reshelved
then
we
have
to
find
a
characteristic
common
to
the
ones
we
want
reshelved
and
mention
that
in
our
sentence
e.g
the
linguistics
books
should
be
reshelved
in
this
case
we
will
be
understood
to
mean
all
the
linguistics
books
the
indefinite
article
a(n
indicates
that
the
speaker/writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
can
not
readily
identify
the
referent
of
the
np
contrast
16a
and
16b
16
a
i

the
wolf
speaker
presents
information
as
readily
accessible
to
the
hearer
e.g

and
hearer

already
identified
a
wolf

are
now
referring
to
it
again
b

information
as
not

sible
to
the
hearer
e.g
speaker
is
introducing
reference
to
a
wolf
into
the
conversation
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
indefinite
article
is
normally
used
to
introduce
a
delahunty
and
garvey
210new
entity
or
topic
into
a
discourse
another
important
meaning
associated
with
the
indefinite
article
is

an
indefinite

denotes
a

of
the
cat

the
family
of
dashwood
had
been
long
settled
in
sussex
their
es
tate
was
large
and
their
residence
was
at
norland
park
in
the
centre
of
their
property
where
for
many
generations
they
had
lived
in
so
respectable
a
manner
as
to
engage
the
general
good
opinion
of
their
surrounding
acquaintances
the
late
owner
of
this
estate
was
a
single
man
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
and
who
for
many
years
of
his
life
had
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
but
her
death
which
happened
ten
years
before
his
own
produced
a
great
alteration
in
his
home
for
to
supply
her
loss
he
invited
and
received
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
mr
henry
dashwood
the
legal
inheritor
of
the
norland
estate
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intended
to
bequeath
it
in
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
neice
and
their
children
the
old
gentleman’s
days
were
comfortably
spent

213
the
minor
parts
of

to
them
all
increased
the
constant
attention
of
mr
and
mrs
henry
dashwood
to
his
wishes
which
proceeded
not
merely
from
interest
but
from
goodness
of
heart
gave
him
every
degree
of
solid
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
children
added
a
relish
to
his
existence
by
a
former
marriage
mr
henry
dashwood
had
one
son
by
his
present
lady
three
daughters
the
son
a
steady
respectable
young
man
was
amply
provided
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
which
had
been
large
and
half
of
which
devolved
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
by
his
own
marriage
likewise
which
happened
soon
afterwards
he
added
to
his
wealth
to
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
norland
estate
was
not
so
really
important
as
to
his

small
auxiliary
verbs
in
this
section
we
discuss
auxiliary
verbs
which
we
mentioned
in
passing
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
auxiliary
verbs
always
occur
with
a
main
verb
though
the
main
verb
may
be
understood
that
is
omitted
and
implied
e.g
did
john
leave
he
did
leave
there
are
only
a
few
aux
iliaries
in
the
language
but
each
plays
several
important
grammatical
and
semantic
roles
the
english
auxiliaries
are
be
have
and
the
modal
verbs
can
could
may
might
shall
should
will
would
must
and
do
which
has
no
meaning
but
patterns
grammatically
like
a
modal
be
is
used
with
a
verb
in
its
ving
form
to
indicate
the
progressive
aspect
e.g
the
students
are
working
on
their
term
papers
be
is
also
used
with
a
past
participle
verb
form
ven
to
create
the
passive
voice
e.g
this
book
was
written
by
two
loony
linguists
have
is
used
with
a
ven
form
to
create
the
perfect
aspect
e.g
the
semester
has
come
to
an
end
do
and
the
modals
are
followed
by
a
verb
in
its
uninflected
form
the
form
used
to
cite
it
in
a
dictionary
e.g
we
shall
overcome
we
discuss
the
progressive
and
perfect
aspects
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
auxiliary
verbs
are
optional
elements
in
a
clause
but
up
to
four
may
oc
cur
together
regardless
of
how
many
occur
they
always
follow
this
order
modal
have
progressive
be
and
passive
be
as
you
can
demonstrate
for
your
self
by
rearranging
them
in
she
may
have
been
being
spied
on
by
homeland
security
agents
you
should
find
that
all
other
orders
are
ungrammatical
the
first
auxiliary
in
a
sentence
is
extremely
important
first
it
is
the
one
delahunty
and
garvey
214that
is
marked
for
tense
if
the
clause
is
finite
in
she
should
have
been
work
ing
on
her
term
paper
should
is
the
first
auxiliary
and
its
d
indicates
that
it

by

modal
verbs
if
a
modal
verb
occurs
in
a
clause
it
will
as
we
noted
be
the
first
of
any
auxiliaries
that
clause
contains
besides
occupying
the
same
sentential
posi

modals
express
related
concepts
these
concepts
include
notions
such
as
a
necessity
either
logical
or
social
obligation
you
must
read
the
book
b
possibility
logical
or
social
permission
he

what
these
modal
concepts
all
have
in
common
is
that
they
indicate
the
basis
for
the
speaker’s
judgment
or
belief
about
the
truth
of
the
sentence
we
can
view
the
d/t
at
the
end
of
the
second
member
of
each
pair
of
modals
as
a
variant
of
the
past
tense
inflection
ed
this
allows
us
to
regard
each
pair
excluding
must
as
comprising
a
present
and
a
past
tense
form
to
see
why
this
is
so
consider
the
phenomenon
called
backshifting
backshifting
involves
the
change
from
present
tense
to
past
tense
forms
when
direct
speech
e.g
john
is
flying
to
toronto
tomorrow
is
converted
into
indirect
speech
when
the
verb
of
the
main
clause
is
in
the
past
tense
john
said
that
he
was
flying
to
toronto
tomorrow
sentences
involving
modals
require
a
shift
from
the
basic
form
to
the
past
tense
d/t
form
john
will
fly
out
tomorrow
becomes
john
said
that
he
would
fly

with
preposi

the
indirect

construction
e.g
he

hilda
the

he

hilda
a

is
sometimes
associated
with
paraphrases
using
the
prepositions
to
he
gave
the
bike
to
hilda
and
for
he
bought
a

for
hilda
however
this
semantic
relation
emerges
only

meaning

has
a

the

however
this
parallelism
is
broken
in
26c
d
in
26c
down
is
grammatical
after
the
np
but
in
26d
it
is
not
this
difference
in
behavior
suggests
that
down
may
represent
two
different
parts
of
speech
in
these
sentences
semantically
we
sense
an
idiomatic
unity
in
cut
down
that
we
do
not
sense
in
fell
down
in
fact
cut
down
could
be
replaced
by
one
word
toppled
or
felled
on
formal
and
semantic
grounds
then
down
seems
to
rep
resent
different
parts
of
speech
in
26a
and
26b
the
fact
that
down
the
hill
seems
to
have
moved
as
a
single
unit
in
26f
suggests
that
in
that
and
related
sentences
down
is
a
preposition
heading
a
prepositional
phrase
for
down
in
26a
we
have
no
ready-made
traditional
label
in
such
sentences
we
will
call
it
a
particle
using
a
term
coined
recently
by
linguists
and
verb
+
particle
combinations
like
cut
down
look
up
we
will
call
phrasal
verbs
next
consider
the
word
down
in
the
sentences
below
27
a
i
fell
down
the
hill
b
i
fell
down
assuming
that
down
is
a
true
preposition
in
27a
we
note
in
27b
that
221
the
minor
parts
of
speechdown
is
not
followed
by
a
noun
phrase
nor
has
it
been
stranded
since
no
noun
phrase
that
could
be
construed
as
its
object
occurs
elsewhere
in
the
sentence
moreover
we
do
not
infer
from
27b
that
i
fell
down
some
in
clined
place—any
more
than
we
understand
that
some
object
did
or
did
not
cause
me
to
fall
since
we
cannot
apply
any
test
of
moveability
to
the
right
that
helped
us
to
identify
particles
we
have
no
justification
for
calling
down
in
27b
a
particle
must
we
then
invent
a
new
part
of
speech
the
answer
is
yes—unless
we
can
fit
the
word
into
some
other
existing
part
of
speech
can
you
think
of
a
candidate
for
the
word
down
consider
sentences
28a
d
28
a
harriet
visited
often
b
often
harriet
visited
c
i
fell
down
d
down
i
fell
these
sentences
provide
evidence
that
down
in
27b/28c
may
be
an
adverb
since
it
fits
criteria
for
adverbs
namely
that
of
relative
moveability
that
it
modifies
a
verb
and
that
it
represents
direction
in
practice
we
would
like
to
have
more
support
for
our
analysis
than
this
but
sometimes
we
do
not
have
that
luxury
we
should
note
however
the
semantic
motivation
for
the
tendency
of
prepositions
to
blend
with
adverbs
if
you
turn
back
to
our
discussion
of
adverbs
you
will
notice
that
the
meanings
expressed
by
adverbs
e.g
time
place
and
manner
partially
coincide
with
those
of
prepositions
this
tendency
for
parts
of
speech
to
overlap
in
meaning
is
just
one
more
reason
to
prefer
an
analysis
that
separates
them
on
the
basis
of
form
intensifiers
our
earlier
discussion
of
adjectives
and
adverbs
made
reference
to
a
class
of
words
specifically
associated
with
them
this
class
includes
words
like
more
most
very
quite
rather
somewhat
and
a
few
others
t
raditional
grammars
often
call
such
words
degree
adverbs
as
if
they
were
ordinary
ad
verbs—like
extremely
and
thoroughly
that
happen
to
indicate
the
extent
to
which
the
meaning
of
the
adjective
or
adverb
holds
if
you
consider
the
criteria
for
adverbs
that
we
suggested
earlier
you
will
quickly
realize
that
the
words
we
have
listed
as
intensifiers—even
though
they
do
indicate
degree—do
not
share
the
formal
or
functional
characteristics
of
adverbs
for
instance
intensifiers
do
not
have
the
moveability
of
true
adverbs
nor
can
they
occur
in
the
comparative
or
superlative
constructions
nor
can

the

role
of
these

namely
to

together
con
two

grammatical

38
lou

but
bud
did
not
admit
his

the
literal
meaning
of
and
is
equivalent
to
mathematical
+
or
logical
&
so
jack
and
jill
means
jack
+/&
jill
so
if
jack
and
jill
went
up
the
hill
is
true
then
jack
went
up
the
hill
is
true
and
jill
went
up
the
hill
is
true
however
in
certain
contexts
and
communicates
more
than
just
+/&
for
example
we
would
normally
interpret
jack
fell
down
and
broke
his
crown
to
mean
jack
fell
down
and
then
because
he
fell
down
he
broke
his
crown
so
amongst
other
meanings
and
can
communicate
the
order
in
which
events
took
place
and
that
an
earlier
event
caused
a
later
one
the
literal
meaning
but
is
pretty
much
equivalent
to
that
of
and
namely
that
both
conjuncts
are
true
however
but
adds
the
complica
tion
that
an
expectation
set
up
by
the
first
conjunct
is
to
be
rejected
for
example
if
you
go
to
the
dean’s
office
and
ask
her
assistant
whether
she
is
in
you
might
get
the
response
she’s
in
but
you
can’t
see
her
now
in
this
case
she’s
in
is
true
and
you
can’t
see
her
now
is
true
but
acknowledges
that
if
she’s
in
is
true
then
you
might
reasonably
expect
that
you
would
be
able
to
see
her
however
it
rejects
this
expectation
like
and
or
can
conjoin
an
indefinite
number
of
expressions
generally
when
or
conjoins
expressions
it
indicates
that
only
one
of
the
expressions
is
true
for
example
if
i
say
george
dick
or
albert
should
go
to
jail
then
i
am
saying
that
only
one
of
the
three
should
go
to
jail
however
i
can
override
this
exclusivity
by
adding
something
like
or
all
three
225
the
minor
parts
of
speechsubordinating
conjunctions
subordinating
conjunctions
as
the
name
suggests
differ
from
coordina
tors
by
connecting
structures
of
unequal
grammatical
status
in
subordina
tion
one
of
the
structures
is
grammatically
superior
or
dominant
and
the
other
is
grammatically
inferior
or
subordinate
the
subordinate
structure
is
a
sub-part
of
the
larger
dominant
structure
as
you’d
expect
the
subor
dinate
structure
is
the
one
introduced
by
the
subordinating
conjunction
a
second
difference
between
coordinating
and
subordinating
conjunc
tions
is
that
the
latter
have
a
restricted
range
they
can
connect
clauses
only
thus
a
structure
introduced
by
a
subordinating
conjunction
will
be
a
sub
ordinate
clause
it
is
of
course
possible
for
one
clause
to
be
subordinate
bolded
to
a
clause
that
is
itself
subordinate
underlined
for
example
the
tv
news
reported
that
the
nominee
claimed
that
he
was
not
a
crook
we
will
investigate
subordinate
clauses
more
fully
in
our
chapter
on
multi
clause
sentences
for
the
moment
we
will
simply
mention
three
important
types
of
subordinate
clause
and
identify
the
conjunctions
that
may
introduce
them
the
subordinating
conjunctions
are
classified
according
to
the
type
of
clause
they
introduce
the
three
types
of
subordinate
clauses
are
adverbial
nominal
and
relative
subordinating
adverbial
conjunctions
adverbial
clauses
like
adverbs
function
as
modifiers
of
verbs
or
sentences
they
are
introduced
by
a
group
of
words
that
we
will
call
subordinating
adverbial
conjunctions

groups
sacs
semantically
in
a
way
that
makes
clear
their
over
lap
with
adverbs
as
we
have
just
seen
prepositions
also
overlap
with
ad
verbs
so
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
prepositions
have
affinities
with
sacs
these
affinities
are
more
than
semantic
several
items
of
table
11
also
appear
on
the
lists
of
prepositions
table
7
and
8
because
of
this
overlap
students
may
experience
difficulties
in
telling
a
preposition
from
a
sac
and
a
prepositional
phrase
from
an
adverbial
clause
a
simple
way
to
keep
the
two
clear
is
to
remember
that
a
preposition
only
occurs
in
construction
with
a
following
noun
phrase
and
a
sac
is
followed
by
a
clause
let’s
con
sider
an
example
39
a
i
left
after
the
party
b
i
left
after
the
party
ended
in
39a
after
is
followed
only
by
a
noun
phrase
the
party
and
so
must
be
a
preposition
in
39b
after
is
followed
by
both
a
noun
phrase
the
party
and
a
verb
phrase
ended
that
together
constitute
a
clause
thus
after
is
a
sac
in
39b
we
can
confirm
our
formal
analysis
further
by
moving
the
group
of
words
after
the
party
40
a
after
the
party
i
left
b
*after
the
party
i
left
ended
since
phrases
often
move
as
a
unit
the
prepositional
phrase
in
39a
can
be
relocated
at
the
front
of
the
sentence
as
it
has
been
in
40a
but
in
39b
after
the
party
cannot
be
moved
as
the
ungrammaticality
of
40b
shows
thus
it
must
not
be
a
complete
expression
in
fact
the
structure
governed
by
after
in
40b
is
the
clause
the
party
ended
as
41
shows
41
after
the
party
ended
i
left
clauses
like
after
the
party
ended
are
adverbial
because
they
function
much
as
adverbs
do
they
have
meanings
similar
to
those
of
adverbs
and
they
are
relatively
moveable

228some
complexities
of

subordinating
conjunctions
have
several
properties
that
make
them
more
complicated
than
this
basic
presentation
suggests
one
that
deserves
men
tion
is
the
tendency
of
subordinating
conjunctions
to
be
omitted
from
sen
tences
in
which
their
presence
is
easily
inferred

relative
why
or
that
a
note
on
that
grammatically
that
is
particularly
interesting
largely
because
it
belongs
to
at
least
four
different
parts
of
speech
first
it
can
be
a
demonstrative
pro
noun
that
functions
either
as
a
modifier
e.g
that
answer
is
correct
or
as
the
head
of
a
noun
phrase
e.g
that
is
correct
second
it
can
introduce
a
relative
clause
e.g
the
answer
that
she
gave
was
correct
third
that
can
act
as
a
noun
clause
connector
e.g
i
said
that
the
answer
was
correct
fourth
it
can
appear
as
part
of
a
subordinating
adverbial
conjunction
indicating
either
result
or
purpose
e.g
the
answer
was
so
persuasive
that
it
astounded
us
all
the
answer
was
phrased
so
that
it
would
confuse
everyone
so
how
can
you
determine
which
class
that
belongs
to
in
a
particular
sentence
one
useful
test
is
that
of
substitution
if
you
can
substitute
it
for
that
you
have
a
headword
demonstrative
if
you
can
substitute
the
you
have
a
modifying
demonstrative
if
you
can
substitute
who
or
which
for
that
it
introduces
a
relative
clause
if
you
cannot
make
any
of
these
replacements
you
have
either
a
noun
clause
connector
or
a
sac
distinguishing
the
sac
is
very
simple
since
it
occurs
normally
with
the
word
so
either
next
to
it
or
nearby
other
minor
parts
of
speech
while
our
catalogue
of
parts
of
speech
includes
nearly
all
the
words
of
eng
lish
we
should
ask
whether
other
categories
might
be
identified
there
is
no
reason
in
principle
to
believe
that
we
have
discovered
all
the
parts
of
speech
any
more
than
to
believe
that
we
have
discovered
all
the
inhabitable
planets
in
our
galaxy
certainly
we
would
expect
to
find
other
parts
of
speech
if
we
dealt
with
languages
other
than
english
japanese
for
instance
has
words
similar
to
229
the
minor
parts
of

prepositions
except
that
they
follow
rather
than
precede
their
associated

phrases
thus
english
of
a
book
would
be
rendered
in
japanese
as
hon
ni
literally
book
of
because
they
follow
their
nouns
these
japanese
words
are
often
called
postpositions
those
familiar
with
traditional
grammar
will
also
recall
one
part
of
speech
that
we
have
not
mentioned
the
interjection
this
class
includes
words
such
as
shucks
darn
gee
wow
and
a
host
of
saltier
expressions
usu
ally
a
grammar
will
list
the
tamer
interjections
and
let
the
matter
drop
interjections
have
some
interesting
properties
first
they
are
not
gram
matically
connected
to
other
parts
of
the
sentences
in
which
they
occur
and
consequently
are
typically
separated
from
the
remainder
of
their
sentence
by
commas
they
typically
indicate
the
speaker’s
attitude
or
feelings
about
what
he
is
expressing
e.g
well
our
budget
deficit
is
not
as
large
as
that
of
the
axis
of
evil
individual
expressions
also
have
certain
unusual
properties

for

enters
into
a
variety
of
constructions

rarely
intended
since
even

can
use
it

aside
from
interjections
we
have
already
seen
one
important
way
in
which
new
parts
of
speech
may
emerge
they
may
be
distinguished
from
other
classes
of
which
they
were
thought
to
be
normal
members
for
in
stance
we
separated
intensifiers
from
the
category
of
adverbs
and
particles
from
prepositions
in
distinguishing
a
group
of

a
separate

linguists
attempt
to
direct
our
attention
to
a
set
of
formal
func
tional
or
semantic
similarities
and
differences
as
a
result
some
catego
ries
will
be
particular
to
a
specific
book
rather
than
to
english
grammar
in
general
the
practice
of
reclassifying
words
is
in
fact
relatively
common
especially
as
we
discover
more
about
language
studying
parts
of
speech
mirrors
the
study
of
ecological
characteristics
of
plants
and
animals
in
na
ture
so
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
as
we
learn
more
about
a
particular
delahunty
and
garvey
230species
we
discover
unexpected
similarities
between
it
and
other
apparently
unrelated
species
thus
if
prepositions
and
adverbs
are
not
as
distinct
as
we
once
thought
our
discovery
of
this
fact
derives
from
our
closer
observation
of
their
verbal
ecology

introduction
in
this
chapter
we
discuss
word
meaning
while
it’s
uncontroversial
that
words
mean
it
is
far
from
clear
how
they
mean
or
indeed
what
meaning
is
because
dictionaries
are
so
familiar
we
begin
our
discussion
from
the
point
of
view
of
dictionary
entries
which
are
designed
primarily
to
describe
the
meanings
of
words
though
they
do
much
else
besides
we
discuss
two
ap
proaches
to
modeling
word
meaning
and
then
move
to
a
discussion
of
the
meanings
of
words
as
they
might
be
stored
in
human
minds
and
of
the
ways
in
which
book
and
mental
dictionaries
are
alike
and
different
we
would
be
surprised
if
anyone
reading
this
book
had
never
consulted
a
dictionary
however
our
experience
over
several
decades
of
teaching
about
language
is
that
very
few
people
read
the
introductions
front
matter
of
dic
tionaries
they
may
have
had
for
many
years
indeed
our
experience
strongly
suggests
that
most
people
believe
in
the
myth
of
the
dictionary
a
unique
authoritative
and
accurate
source
of
information
on
words
their
spellings
meanings
and
histories
of
which
actual
dictionaries
are
merely
longer
or
shorter
versions
everyone
especially
teachers
should
be
aware
that
dictionaries
are
not
all
cut
from
the
same
cloth
rather
they
differ
in
substantial
ways
which
their
users
ignore
at
the
cost
of
misinterpreting
what
they
read
the
goals
of
the
exercise
just
below
are
to
raise
your
awareness
of
the
differences
among
dictionaries
to
show
you
that
it
is
essential
to
adopt
as
critical
a
stance
toward
dictionaries
as
you
would
toward
any
other
commercial
product
and
to
encourage
you
to
examine
dictionaries
carefully
as
you
buy
them
for
yourselves
have
them
bought
for
your
schools
or
recommend
them
to
your
students
more
generally
teachers
and
students
should
have
some
appreciation
of
the
complexity
of
issues
regarding
linguistic
meaning
a
topic
that
has
chal
lenged
western
thinking
for
over
two
and
a
half
millennia
we
have
included
several
items
in
our
references
and
resources
to
this
chapter
that
we
hope
will
help
develop
that
appreciation
the
chapter
will
give
you
a
basic
vocab
ulary
for
use
in
conceptualizing
and
discussing
meaning
as
well
as
concepts
delahunty
and
garvey
236to

and

dictionary
entries
dictionaries
are
probably
the
sources
of
information
on
words
you
are
most
familiar
with
so
we
begin
our
discussion
of
words
by
exploring
the
information
dictionaries
provide
and
the
ways
in
which
they
present
it
exercise

just
to
see
how
much
you
may
have
been
taking
for
granted
and
how
much
of
that
was
right
and
how
much
was
mistaken

your
purposes
e.g
for
your
own
personal
or
professional
uses
or
to
recommend
to
the
kinds
of
students
you
may
teach
we
think
you
will
learn
a
lot
about
dictionaries
by
comparing
contrasting
a
learner’s
dictionary
with
one
for
native
english
speak
ers
make
sure
to
give
their
full
names
editions
publishers
dates
of
publication
and
sizes
indicate
the
size
of
the
dictionaries
by
number
of
pages
or
entries
your
instructor
should
approve
your
choice
of
dic
tionaries
before
you
begin
as
this
is
to
be
a
critical
review
you
should
clearly
articulate
for
yourself
and
your
readers
the
criteria
you
use
to
evaluate
the
dictionaries
compare
contrast
their
front
matters
i.e
everything
from
the
front
cover
to
the
beginning
of
the
alphabetical
listing
of
words
and
their
back
matters
i.e
everything
from
the
end
of
the

listings
to
the
inside

cover
pay
particular
attention
to
a
the

b

the
ways
in

e.g
for
students
you
might

yourself

the

are

imagine

you
might
reasonably
expect
to

criteria
would
you
use

to

dictionaries
are
designed
to
provide
readily

information
about
the
words
of
one
or
more

many

provide
far
more
information
than
that
they
may
include

of
colleges
and
universities
us
presidents
the
us
constitution
and
the
like
while
they
may
expand
their
domains
in
certain
respects
they
may
narrow
them
in
others
some
dictionaries
are
designed
for
college
students
and
include
words
that
the
editors
believe
are
most
relevant
to
that
market
segment
and
we
must
never
forget
that
dictionaries
are
commercial
products
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
dictionary
other
dictionaries
are
devoted
to

still
others

many

at
how
the

words
are
expressed
if
the
dictionary
is
not
a
bilingual
one
then
the
definitions
are
expressed
in
the
same
language
as
the
headword
so
there
is
a
built-in
circularity
for
example

sodium

english
learners’

attempt
to

of
synonyms
distinguished
by
com
ments
after
the
main
body
of
the

after

they

antonyms
are
traditionally
defined
as
words
with
op

meanings
such
as
up

down
good
and
bad
and
the
like
though
they
must
share
some
important
aspect
of
their
meanings
for

large
and
small
share
the
notion
of
size
however
apple

are

antonyms

they
share

any

we
distinguish
several
types
of
antonym
cruse
1986

complementary
antonyms
are
pairs
of
words
such
that
if
one
word
ap
plies
the
other
cannot
for
example
alive
and
dead
if
a
person
is
alive
he
or
she
cannot
be
dead
and
vice
versa
other
examples
are
hit-miss
pass-fail
open-closed
gradable
antonyms
denote
opposing
positions
on
some
scale
for
ex
ample
hot
and
cold
indicate
opposite
positions
on
a
temperature
scale
be
cause
scales
are
continuous
phenomena
we
can
indicate
varying
positions
on
them
by
modifying
the
words
e.g
hotter
hottest
awfully
hot
miserably
cold
the
values
between
and
beyond
the
antonyms
may
also
be
lexicalized
in
between
hot
and
cold
we
have
warm
tepid
cool
and
beyond
hot
and
cold
there
is
burning
scalding
and
freezing
among
others
other
gradable
pairs
include
tall-short
wide-narrow
big-small
strong-weak
heavy-light
high-low
you
probably
noticed
that
the
members
of
these
pairs
are
not
entirely
parallel
one
seems
to
be
more
basic
or
unmarked
than
the
other
we
use
the
basic
unmarked
form
to
ask
questions
when
we
have
no
specific
expectation
that
the
marked
form
describes
the
situation
i.e
when
the
question
is
not
loaded
toward
the
marked
form
for
example
ordinarily
if
we
want
to
know
how
strong
someone
is
we
simply
ask
how
strong
is
he
or
she
if
however
we
assume
that
this
person
is
weaker
than
some
norm
then
we
use
the
marked
member
of
the
word
pair
how
weak
is
he
or
she
the
marked
unmarked
distinction
is
important
in
certain
literary

non-gradable
antonyms
cannot
be
modified
often
because
they
denote
absolute
differences
e.g
metabolic
is
non-gradable
it
does
not
accept
the
comparative
or
the
superlative
or
modification
by

other

utter
reversive
antonyms
are
words
that
represent
movement
in
opposite
di
rections
such
as
advance-retreat
go
away)-come
back
ascend-descend
rise
fall
go-return
fill-empty
open-close
conversive
antonyms
represent
the
same
situation
from
two
points
of
view
for
example
if
the
cat
is
higher
than
the
bird
then
the
bird
is
lower
than
the
cat
the
vertical
relationship
between
the
bird
and
the
cat
can
be
viewed
from
two
points
of
view
lower
than
and
higher
than
another
ex
ample
is
wife-husband
if
tarzan
is
jane’s
husband
then
jane
is
tarzan’s
wife
other
examples
include
buy-sell
give-receive
own-belong
to
above-below
while
synonyms
and
antonyms
are
words
at
the
same
semantic
level
word
meanings
may
also
be
hierarchically
related
to
each
other
for
ex

a

a
kind
of
duck
which
is

we

duck
mallard
the

bird
is

the

mallard
or
from
the
bottom
up
the
meaning
mallard
includes
the

duck
which
includes
the

this
relationship
is
called
hyponymy
the
lower
terms
are
the
hyponyms
of
the
higher
terms
which
are
the
superordinates
or
hypernyms
of
the

similarly
the

how
do
we
know
words
have
meaning
by
posing
this
question
we
do
not
intend
to
cast
doubt
on
the
proposition
that
words
have
meanings
rather
we
want
to
spell
out
some
good
reasons
to
believe
it
in
our
chapter
on
concepts
of
language
we
observed
that
our
linguistic
competence
allows
us
to
do
many
things
recall
that
competence
is
unconscious
linguistic
knowledge
which
includes
knowledge
of
the
meanings
of
words
examples
such
as
the
ones
below
tell
us
only
that
such
knowledge
must
exist
not
what
it
actually
is
our
competence
enables
us
to
distinguish
between
well
and
ill-formed
strings
of
words
and
to
detect
grammatical
struc
ture
crucially
for
our
current
discussion
it
enables
us
to
detect
meaning
relations
among
expressions
including
whether
an
expression
has
a
coher
ent
meaning
or
not
1a
whether
expressions
paraphrase
each
other
that
is
whether
they
are
synonymous
1b
whether
words
are
related
by
hyponymy
1c
partonymy

antonymy

whether
a

1f
and
whether
a
word
is

as
well
as
all
the
other
meaning
relations
we
identified
above
these
abilities
are
strong
evidence
that
word

are
real
and
not
just
figments
of
linguists’
imaginations

it

would
be

cal

examples
such
as
those
in

could
easily
be
multiplied
but
these
few
should
make
clear
a
simple
idea
linguistic
competence
includes
an
unconscious
knowledge
of
the
literal
meanings
of
words
while
this
conclusion
might
seem
trivial
it
conceals
several
less-than-obvious
points
first
it
suggests
that
253
word
meaningspeakers
carry
around
in
their
minds
something
like
a
dictionary
of
their
language
however
there
is
good
evidence
that
speakers’
mental
dictionaries
are
quite
different
from
the
book
dictionaries
of
a
language
for
instance
no
book
dictionary
will
tell
you
that
the
words

cannot
literally
be
combined

linguists
often
use
the
terms
lexicon
or
mental
lexicon
to
refer
to
this
aspect
of
our
linguistic
competence
and
to
emphasize
its
difference
from
written
dictionaries
in
fact
the
nature
of
the
mental
lexicon
is
still
unclear
we
will
explore
some
of
its
characteristics
below
second
you
should
not
confuse
knowing
the
meaning
of
a
word
with
being
able
to
give
it
a
satisfactory
definition
definition-stating
is
a
learned
ability
and
is
only
marginally
necessary
in
most
communication
it
is
also
far
beyond
the
normal
capacities
of
people
the
eminent
lexicographer
sidney
landau
expresses
the
point
simply
by
general
definer
he
means
one
versed
in
common
rather
than
technical
vocabulary
it
is
difficult
to
find
highly
skilled
general
definers
such
people
are
about
as
rare
as
good
poets
there
are
probably
fewer
than

since

linguists
have
struggled
to
present
more
plausible
ones
besides
having
to
account
for
the
observations
noted
above
they
must
also
explain
the
fact
that
while
the
human
brain
is
finite
an
individual’s
vocabulary
may
be
very
large
estimates
for
an
educated
person’s

run

exactly
the

if
this
is
so
how
can
we
hope
to
describe
the
vastness
and
variability
of
lexical
competence
a
general
solution
is
to
describe
not
the
vocabulary
of
a
single
individual
or
the
entire
word-hoard
of
english
but
instead
to
envisage
the
general
properties
according
to
which
the
vocabulary
of
any
individual—or
of
any
language—can
be
con
structed

our
semantic

does
not
consist
of

at
all

rather
of
knowing
how
words
relate

of

these

are

called

though
some
times
you

components
are
often
regarded
as
pure
concepts
not
to
be
equated
with
the
words
of
any
language
which
is
why
they
are
typically
written
in

from
this

view
a

essentially
a
shorthand
way
of
grouping
a

are

a
sample
of
those
that
have
been
proposed
but
they
are
adequate
to
illustrate
the
thrust
of
the
c
model
for
instance
in
this
model
the
word
alive
is
shorthand
for
the
component
animate
dead
is
shorthand
for
not
alive

for
become

the
com
ponents
are
independent
of
the
parts
of

of
the

to
which
they
apply
you
might
object
that
such
definitions
are
grossly
oversimplified
a
valid
concern
at
the
very
least
how
the

are
related
to

these
issues
raise
technicalities
which
need
not
detain
us
here
for
ways
to
deal
with
them
you
might
read
work
on
this
topic
e.g
ch

of
jackendoff

it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
the
universality
of
the
list
of
com
ponents
and
their
language
specific
uses
the
features
mentioned
in
table

are
quite
likely
to
be
universal
that
is
having
the
potential
to
be
used
in
the
creation
of
word
meanings
in
any
and
all
languages
while
there
may
be
com
ponents
that
are
specific
to
individual
languages
there
are
linguists
who
claim
to
have
identified
a
universal
set
of
semantic
primitives
anna
wierzbicka
probably
makes
the
strongest
claim
in
that
regard—see

is
an
accessible
introduction
to
that
style
of
doing

while
linguists
may
claim
that
the
sets
of
primitives
they
propose
are
uni
versal
no
one
claims
that
they
are
bundled
together
in
the
same
way
in
all
languages
for
instance
while
both
english
and
french
both
make
use
of
the
component
female
they
use
it
in
different
ways
both
languages
indicate
the
female
member
of
certain
pairs
of
words
morphologically
lion
lioness
lion
lionne
however
the
two
languages
differ
in
that

we
must
also
distinguish
between
central
and
more
marginal
aspects
of
a
word’s
meaning
you
might
argue
that
cannibal
suggests
primitiveness
war
fare
initiation
or
absorption
of
the
characteristics
of
the
person
devoured
however
these
are
not
essential
components
of
the
meaning
of
cannibal
a
cannibal
is
still
a
cannibal
even
if
he
is
a
highly
educated
rugby
player
the
marginal
aspects
of
the
meaning
of
cannibal
can
be
regarded
as
its
conno
tations
the
connotations
of
words
are
often
variable
across
speakers
of
a
language
and
typically
express
emotional
associations
different
words
that
may
be
used
for
the
same
things
may
convey
different
feelings
about
them
for
example
woman
and
lady
may
refer
to
the
same
entities
but
they
convey
rather
different
attitudes
toward
them

the

it
unlikely
that
a

suffice
to
differentiate
all

we

a

native

between

some

take

as

the

fails
to
make

that

even

remember
that
saying
that

a

of

is
to
say
that
the
referents
of
the
hyponym
are
a
subset
of
the

another
more

to

this
is
to

that

the

are
a

of
the

of
the

by

at
this
point
we
should
take
a
closer
look
at
how
categories
and
words
are
related
and
what
it
means
to
belong
to
a
category
we’ll

the
simplest
possible
assumption
about
the
relation
between
words
and

let’s
imagine
that
we
are
in
a
context
in
which
we
are
talking
about
technical
matters
and
that
we
are
expected
to
be
technically
correct
a
simple
example
of
such
a
context
might
be
a
discus
sion
about
plane
figures
in
a
geometry
course
in
such
a
context
when
we
use
the
word
square
we
mean
a
plane

having
four
equal

wnwd
p

no
more
and
no
less
the
elements
of
the
definition
plane
figure
four
equal
sides
and
four
right
angles
are
all
necessary
to
define
square
and
together
they
are
sufficient
for
its
definition
when
scholars
try
to
define
technical
concepts
they
generally
try
to
define
them
in
terms
of
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
if
they
succeed
then
in
principle
it
is
possible
to
decide
for
any
item
whether
it
is
a
representative
of
that
category
or
not
given
our
definition
of
square
we
can
decide
for
anything
whether
it
is
a
square
or
not
the
world
however
is
not
always
as
rigid
as
a
geometry
class
imagine
now
that
we
have
been
rescued
from
the
math
discussion
and
we
go
to
a
birthday
party
where
there
is
a
flat
layer
cake
cut
into
squares
if
you
noticed
that
the
pieces
did
not
meet
the
mathematical
definition
could
you
reasonably
object
that
the
pieces
are
not
really
squares
anyone
objecting
on
those
grounds
wouldn’t
deserve
any
cake
as
far
as
we
know
there
is
no
english
word
for
the
almost
square
pieces
that
a
flat
cake
is
cut
into
so
until
someone
invents
such
a
word
and
it
is
widely
accepted
we
can
use
square
and
our
audience
will
accommodate
us
these
kinds
of
ac
commodations
lead
to
rampant
polysemy
in
much
of
the
vocabulary
so
it
is
important
to
remember
that
polysemy
accommodation
and
context
are
inextricably
intertwined
if
words
and
categories
were
all
defined
in
necessary
and
sufficient
terms
then
categories
could
be
kept
clearly
distinct
as
squares
and
triangles
are
in
geometry
but
if
we
can
bend
these
definitions
or
if
we
cannot
provide
nec
essary
and
sufficient
definitions
for
categories
then
the
boundaries
between
categories
may
get
quite
fuzzy
in
fact
many
natural
categories
are
like
this
where
exactly
does
red
end
and
orange
begin
where
do
animals
end
and
plants
begin
we
are
unlikely
to
get
unanimous
agreement
on
the
answers
to
such
questions

nonetheless
in
ordinary
non-technical
company
we
cut
each
other
some
slack
by
not
expecting
words
always
to
be
used
with
technical
rigidity
we
can
also
indicate
when
we
are
using
words
imprecisely
by
using
hedges
such
as

we
can

many
dictionary
definitions
are
expressed
in
terms
of

function
that
something
serves
for
example

a

or

on

a

swings
p

suppose
that
no
one
had
oiled
the
hinge
in
decades
and
it
could
no
longer
swing—is
it
still
a
hinge
the
answer
is
undoubtedly
yes
just
as
a
dog
with

is
still
a

these
may
be

mem
bers
how
much
change
must
be
endured
before
something
is
no
longer
accepted
as
a
member
of
its
original
category
what
does
a
dog
have
to
give
up
before
it
is
no
longer
a
dog
whatever
the
answer
to
that
question
is
it
is
clear
that
we
can
adjust
our
assumptions
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
member
of
a
category
to
accommodate
defective
members
as
we
have
seen
categories
typically
have
many
members
in
fact
po
tentially
indefinitely
many
the
more
general
categories
have
multiple
sub
categories
which
in
turn
may
have
their
own
subcategories
however
some
category
members
are
viewed
as
better
members
of
the
category
than
others
for
instance
chairs
and
sofas
are
regarded
as
better
items
of
furniture
than
refrigerators
robins
and
sparrows
are
better
birds
than
penguins
or
ostrich
es
shirts
and
skirts
are
better
pieces
of
clothing
than
shoes
and
socks
this
layering
of
category
members
extends
even
to
things
defined
in
terms
of
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
such
as
prime
numbers
for
example
3
is
a
better
prime
number
than
23
even
though
both
fit
the
technical
defini
tion
it
has
been
argued
that
categories
are
structured
around
a
central
most
typical
member
or
prototype
e.g
chairs
in
the
case
of
furniture
robins
in
the
case
of
birds
and
so
on
exercise
let’s
try
to
determine
the
prototypical
member
of
a
category
as
quick
ly
as
you
can
write
out
a
list
of
ten
vegetables
then
compile
the
lists
of
all
the
students
in
your
class
order
the
vegetable
names
accord
ing
to
their
frequency
in
the
lists
then
take
the
three
most
frequent
words
and
check
how
early
they
occur
in
the
lists
generally
the
most
frequent
ones
will
occur
early
the
earliest
and
most
frequent
word
probably
represents
the
most
prototypical
member
of
the
category
of
vegetables
dictionaries
indicate
certain
aspects
of
prototypicality
in
their
defini
tions
for
example
wnwd
p
1051
describes
a
penguin
as
a
flightless
delahunty
and
garvey
266bird
this
negative
definition
suggests
that
the
typical
bird
is
not
flightless
similarly
wnwd
describes
dodoes
p
414
as
having
rudimentary
wings
useless
for
flying
and
ostriches
p
1007
as
having
small
useless
wings
presumably
prototypical
wings
are

book
and
mental
dictionaries
differ
also
in
the
amount
of
information
they
provide
about
the
collocational
properties
of
words
for
example
if
we
leave
fat
bacon
butter
or
oil
sitting
around
long
enough
it
will
become
rancid
e.g
rancid
bacon
however
if
we
leave
fruit
vegetables
or
eggs
sit
ting
they
will
become
rotten
e.g
rotten
apple
so
rancid
collocates
with
the
words
for
fatty
or
oily
substances
and
rotten
collocates
with
words
for
fruits
vegetables
and
the
like
one
word
collocates
with
another
if
they
occur
together
in
phrases
more
frequently
than
their
meanings
alone
would
predict
for
example
green
collocates
with
envy
as
in
green
with
envy
far
more
frequently
than
other
color
names
for
example
blue
likewise
blue
collocates
with
face
as
in
blue
in
the
face
far
more
frequently
than
other
color
names
except
perhaps
for
red
as
in
red
in
the
face
so
collocations
are
relatively
predict
able
co-occurrences
of
words
in
phrases
mental
dictionaries
include
far
richer
collocational
information
than
book
dictionaries
do
the
interpretation
of
a
word
may
depend
on
what
it
collocates
with
so
dirty
means
unfair
when
it
collocates

when
it

we
can
look
at
collocation
as
largely
a
matter
of
field
when
the
poly
semous
word
morphology
collocates
with
words
like
derivational
and
inflec
tional
then
we
know
we
are
in
the
field
of
linguistics
and
that
it
is
to
be
interpreted
as
denoting
word-structure
until
recently
linguists
paid
rela
tively
little
attention
to
collocation
but
with
the
development
of
very
large
computerized
databases
of
spoken
and
written
language
corpora
and
the
programs
to
search

concordancers
we

expect
collocation

a

some

collocates

note

the

has
to

that

of

about
the

268mation
about

the
like
and
the
ways
in

make
use

in

our
discussion
of

showed
that
they
are
not
alphabetically

and
that
for
all
the
information
contained
in
even
the
most
comprehensive
dictionary
our
mental

include
even
more

introduction
no

you
have
noticed
that
our
discussion
of
parts
of
speech
required
us
to
consider
the
phrases
they
occurred
in
although
traditional
grammars
often
treat
word
classes
apart
from
their
roles
in
larger
structures
it
is
really
not
possible
to
do
so
for
one
thing

cannot
study
a
word’s
functions
without
viewing
it
in

for
another
a
single
word
may
con
stitute
a
phrase
for
instance
a
noun
phrase
may
contain
just
a
noun—its
head
likewise
a
verb
phrase
may
contain
just
a
verb
phrases
then
are
units
of
one
or
more
words
they
are
the
lowest
syntactic
unit
it
is
important
for
us
to
know
about
phrases
and
to
be
able
to
distinguish
them
from
words
and
clauses
this
knowledge
is
essential
in
at
least
the
two
following
situations
journeyman
writers
often
produce
fragments
that
is
parts
of
sentences
punctuated
as
if
they
were
sentences
these
fragments
are
rarely
just
random
strings
of
words
rather
they
are
typically
internally
grammatical
they
are
in
fact
phrases
fragments
are
objected
to
because
they
are
not
the
type
of
expression
that
more
experienced
writers
would
use
in
the
context
they
are
often
a
reflection
of
linguistic
patterns
used
in
speech
and
indicate
that
the
writer
has
not
yet
mastered
the
stylistic
differences
between
the
spoken
and
written
modes
languages
differ
in
the
orders
they
impose
on
sequences
of
words
for
example
in
english
and
many
other
languages
adjectives
typically
pre
cede
the
nouns
they
modify
whereas
in
spanish
and
many
other
languag
es
adjectives
typically
follow
the
nouns
they
modify
language
learners
must
learn
the
orders
expected
in
the
target
language
their
teachers
must
know
the
ordering
possibilities
and
be
able
to
articulate
them
in
ways
their
students
can
learn
from
as
we
examine
phrases
then
we
study
how
words
relate
to
each
other
in
the
smallest
of
the
larger
linguistic
structures
in
our
chapters
on
basic
delahunty
and
garvey
274clause
patterns
and
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
we
examine
the
ways
in
which
phrases
form
clauses

we
will
discuss
each
of
the
five
types
in
a
similar
way
first
we
will
exam
ine
their
basic
functional
patterns
then
how
those
functions
are
realized
by
structural
possibilities
and
where
appropriate
we
will
explore
some
of
the
complexities
associated
with
each
type
of
phrase
whenever
such
complexi
ties
lead
us
to
topics
considered
in
another
chapter
we
will
provide
a
brief
commentary
and
defer
fuller
treatment
to
a
later
time
what
is
a
phrase
t
raditionally
phrase
is
defined
as
a
group
of
words
that
does
not
contain
a
verb
and
its
subject
and
is
used
as
a
single
part
of
speech
this
definition
entails
three
characteristics
1
it
specifies
that
only
a
group
of
words
can
constitute
a
phrase
implying
that
a
single
word
cannot
2
it
distinguishes
phrases
from
clauses
and
3
it
requires
that
the
groups
of
words
believed
to
be
a
phrase
constitute
a
single
grammatical
unit
we
accept
2
and
3
but
must
revise
1
we
reject
the
claim
that
single
words
cannot
constitute
phrases
first
a
word
and
a
phrase
may
play
identical
grammatical
roles
in
a
clause
as
1
and
2
demonstrate
1
most
of
the
members
of
the
genus
avis
fly
2
birds
fly
most
of
the
members
of
the
genus
avis
is
the
subject
of
1
and
birds
is
the
sub
ject
of
2
showing
that
single
words
and
phrases
can
function
identically
in
clauses
there
are
two
inferences
that
we
can
draw
from
this
fact
a
a
subject
can
consist
of
either
a
single
noun
or
a
noun
phrase
or
b
subjects
are
phrases
and
so
whatever
functions
as
a
subject
must
be
a
phrase
if
we
assume
a
then
whenever
we
define
subject
and
any
other
grammatical
function
such
as
predicate
direct
object
indirect
object
etc
we
must
always
specify
that
it
can
be
expressed
as
a
word
or
as
a
phrase
linguists
275
phraseswould
say
that
this
formulation
is
more
complex
than
it
needs
to
be
because
it
fails
to
articulate
a
more
general
pattern
the
broader
generalization
is
that
these
grammatical
relations
are
always
expressed
as
phrases
and
phrases
can
consist
of
either
a
single
word
or
a
unified
group
of
words
below
we
will
show
how
and
when
words
can
be
phrases
second
single
words
and
phrases
may
be
replaced
by
identical
proforms
we
can
replace
the
subjects
of
both
1
and
2
with
they
1
a
they
fly
2
a
they
fly
again
there
are
two
inferences
we
can
draw
a
pronouns
can
replace
ei
ther
a
noun
or
a
noun
phrase
or
b
pronouns
replace
phrases
again
b
is
more
general
but
it
does
require
us
to
specify
when
words
can
function
as
phrases
a
single
word
may
be
a
phrase
when
it
is
the
head
of
that
phrase
the
head
of
a
phrase
is
the
phrase’s
central
element
any
other
words
or
phrases
in
the
phrase
orient
to
it
either
by
modifying
it
or
complementing
it
the
head
determines
the
phrase’s
grammatical
category
if
the
head
is
a
noun
the
phrase
is
a
noun
phrase
if
the
head
is
a
verb
the
phrase
is
a
verb
phrase
and
so
on
the
head
can
also
determine
the
internal
grammar
of
the
phrase
if
the
head
is
a
noun
then
it
may
be
modified
by
an
article
if
the
head
is
a
transitive
verb
it
must
be
complemented
by
a
direct
object
heads
also
determine
such
things
as
the
number
of
their
phrases
if
the
head
of
an
np
is
singular
then
the
np
is
singular
if
the
head
is
plural
then
the
np
is
plural
crucially
the
head
of
a
phrase
may
occur
alone
in
the
phrase
that
is
without
modification
or
complementation
let’s
look
a
little
closer
at
what
expressions
may
be
replaced
by
pronouns
specifically
let’s
test
the
claim
made
in
many
textbooks
that
pronouns
can
replace
nouns
or
noun
phrases
consider
3
3
fooster
hates
the
cabbage
np
det
n
the
cabbage
if
we
replace
the
np
the
cabbage
in
3
with
the
pronoun
it
we
get
the
per
fectly
grammatical
3a
delahunty
and
garvey
276
3
a
fooster
hates
it
np
pron
it
however
given
the
typical
textbook
definition
of
pronoun
as
a
word
that
can
replace
either
nouns
or
noun
phrases
we
should
be
able
to
replace
just
the
noun
cabbage
in
3
with
it
however
when
we
do
so
we
create
the
wildly
ungrammatical
3b
3
b
*fooster
hates
the
it
so
why
is
3a
fine
but
3b
is
not
to
create
3a
we
replaced
the
entire
phrase
the
cabbage
but
for
3b
we
replaced
only
a
part
of
the
phrase
it
ap
pears
that
when
we
pronominalize
we
must
replace
an
entire
phrase
with
a
pronoun
not
just
a
random
piece
of
it
it
follows
that
if
we
can
successfully
replace
an
expression
with
a
pronoun
then
that
expression
must
be
a
com
plete
phrase
to
check
this
consider
what
happens
when
we
replace
cabbage
in
3c
with
a
pronoun
we
get
the
grammatical
3d
3
c
fooster
hates
cabbage
np
3
d
fooster
hates
it
n
cabbage
so
cabbage
is
just
a
noun
in
3
and
therefore
cannot
be
replaced
by
a
pro
noun
but
in
3c
it
is
both
a
noun
and
a
noun
phrase
as
the
diagram
shows
and
so
can
be
pronominalized
proved
by
the
fact
that
3d
is
gram
matical
let’s
add
just
one
more
test
to
the
two
tests
for
phrasehood
we’ve
already
used
capable
of
functioning
as
a
grammatical
relation
and
capable
of
being
replaced
by
a
pronoun
if
an
expression
can
be
moved
from
one
part
of
a
sentence
to
another
without
any
internal
reorganization
then
that
expres
sion
is
a
phrase
we
can
use
our
cabbage
sentences
for
this
test
too
we
can
successfully
move
the
cabbage
in
3
to
the
left
of
the
subject
giv
ing
us
3
e
the
cabbage
fooster
hates
277
phrases
but
when
we
try
to
move
just
the
n
cabbage
the
result
is
ungrammatical
just
as
when
we
tried
to
pronominalize
cabbage
in
3
3
f
*cabbage
fooster
hates
the
analogously
when
we
move
cabbage
in
3c
in
which
cabbage
occurs
alone
the
result
is
also
grammatical
3
g
cabbage
fooster
hates
so
we’ve
applied
three
tests—ability
to
function
as
a
grammatical
rela
tion
pronominalization
and
movement—and
all
three
have
yielded
the
same
results
a
phrase
may
consist
of
a
unified
group
of
words
or
of
a
single
word
as
long
as
that
word
is
the
phrase’s
head
there
is
an
important
methodological
precept
here
the
more
arguments
you
can
marshal
in
favor
of
your
analysis
and
definitions
the
more
confi
dence
you
can
place
in
them
our
new
improved
definition
of
phrase
a
phrase
is
a
grammatical
unit
intermediate
between
a
word
and
a
clause
which
may
consist
of
just
one
word
its
head
or
its
head
and
expressions
including
other
phrases
that
modify
or
complement
it
see
below
this
definition
retains
the
traditional
distinc
tions
between
word
and
phrase
and
between
phrase
and
clause
it
adds
the
requirement
that
phrases
have
heads
and
allows
a
phrase
to
consist
of
just
its
head
in
considering
word
classes
we
examined
the
most
important
ones
first
in
this
chapter
we
will
present
the
three
less
complex
types
first
adverb
prepositional
and
adjective
the
reason
for
this
seemingly
backwards
ap
proach
is
that
the
two
major
phrase
types
noun
phrases
and
verb
phras
es—often
include
the
minor
types
as
subparts
but
first
we
must
make
a
brief
detour
to
discuss
the
important
distinction
between
modification
and
complementation
modification
and
complementation
the
head
of
a
phrase
may
be
modified
or
complemented
by
other
words
phrases
or
sentences
within
the
phrase
we
begin
with
complementation
as
it
is
perhaps
the
more
easily
understood
when
one
element
in
an
expression
creates
the
grammatical
expectation
that
another
expression
will
also
occur
the
expected
element
complements
the
expecting
element
for
example
transitive
verbs
create
the
expectation
of
an
object
as
in
sheila
fractured
her
ankle
bitransitive
verbs
create
the
delahunty
and
garvey
278expectation
of
two
objects
as
in
sally
gave
her
a
shot
of
morphine
certain
other
verbs
create
the
expectation
of
two
complements
though
one
or
both
need
not
be
an
np
as
in
she
put
her
first
aid
kit
away/in
the
truck
gener
ally
although
verbs
in
english
require
a
subject
subjects
are
not
usually
said
to
complement
the
verb
verbs
are
the
primary
complement-requiring
elements
in
language
but
other
parts
of
speech
may
require
complements
too
prepositions
typically
require
an
np
complement
on
may
be
complemented
by
a
phrase
denot
ing
notions
such
as
location
or
time
as
in
on
the
pavement
on
your
mark
on
time
certain
nouns
may
be
complemented
by
clauses
as
in
the
belief
that
diseases
are
caused
by
evil
spirits
modification
occurs
in
a
construction
in
which
an
expression
is
accom
panied
by
an
element
not
grammatically
required
by
it
for
example
be
cause
nouns
do
not
typically
require
adjectives
eager
modifies
fans
in
eager
fans
verbs
and
adjectives
do
not
typically
require
that
they
be
accompanied
by
adverbials
so
violently
modifies
swore
in
swore
violently
and
disappoint
ingly
modifies
slow
in
disappointingly
slow
modification
may
be
restrictive
or
non-restrictive
when
one
word
re
strictively
modifies
another
the
modifier
restricts
the
potential
reference
of
the
modified
for
example
in
the
phrase
long
books
the
adjective
long
re
strictively
modifies
the
noun
books
if
the
word
books
were
to
occur
alone
then
it
could
potentially
refer
to
any
and
all
types
of
books
the
modifier
restricts
the
reference
of
the
phrase
to
just
those
books
that
are
long
nouns
may
have
many
modifiers
as
in
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
short
haired
cat
here
we
have
six
modifiers
each
restricting
the
potential
refer
ence
of
the
word
cat
the
result
of
piling
up
these
modifiers
is
that
the
actual
referent
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
all
of
them—it
must
be
a
cat
that
is
tall
black
neutered
male
domestic
and
short-haired
each
modifier
acts
like
a
criterion
that
the
ultimate
referent(s
of
the
phrase
must
satisfy
there
are
two
main
classes
of
modifying
words
in
english—adjectives
and
adverbs
adjectives
modify
nouns
and
adverbs
modify
pretty
much
ev
erything
else—verbs
adjectives
other
adverbs
and
sentences
they
modify
these
in
much
the
same
way
as
adjectives
modify
nouns—by
adding
criteria
that
must
be
met
for
example
in
ran
quickly
quickly
modifies
ran
and
therefore
requires
that
whoever
ran
didn’t
run
in
any
old
way
but
did
it
quickly
other
examples
include
expressions
like
take
regularly
needs
help
immediately
likewise
intensely
in
intensely
bright
requires
that
the
bright
ness
be
intense
cf
specially
packaged
medically
appropriate
irritatingly
in
irritatingly
slowly
requires
that
whatever
is
going
on
must
not
only
be
going
on
slowly
but
so
slowly
as
to
be
irritating
to
someone
cf
extremely
cleverly
279
phrasesunfortunately
in
unfortunately
he
didn’t
make
it
back
requires
not
only
that
he
didn’t
make
it
back
but
also
that
the
speaker
feels
that
it
is
unfortunate
that
he
didn’t

complete
without

modifiers—though
of
course
adding

removing

referents
of
the
modified
elements

information
that
is
not
essential

the
identification

will

the

of

not

information
to

adds

the
term
adverbial
refers
to
adverb
phrases
and
all
other
expression
types
that
function
in
the

that

do
namely
as

all

of

none
it
may
seem
odd
to
treat
a
preposition
as
the
head
of
a
phrase
because
traditional
grammar
may
have
persuaded
us
to
regard
the
preposition
as
in
significant
in
fact
prepositions
express
meanings
that
encompass
the
entire
range
of
key
semantic
relations
in
a
sentence
another
sign
of
the
importance
of
prepositional
phrases
is
their
ability
to
appear
in
so
many
structures—with
in
noun
phrases
verb

and
adjective
phrases
the
second

of

a

the

the

are
the
articles
which
we
briefly
discussed
in

on
minor
parts
of

here
we
will
elaborate
on
that
discussion
we
noted
that
one
major
use
of
an
article
is
to
indicate
whether
the
np
in
which
it
occurs
is
definite
or
not
if
the
np
is
definite
then
the
speaker
writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
can
identify
the
referent
of
the
np
and
if
the
np
is
indefinite
then
the
speaker/writer
assumes
that
the
hearer/reader
291
phrasescannot
identify
its
referent
yet
another
meaning
associated
with
nps
is
that
of
referentiality
a
referring
np
may
be
either
definite
or
indefinite
but
it
denotes
a
particular
entity
or
set
of
entities
the
bold
np
in
the/a
man
sat
down
refers
to
some
particular
man
the
opposite
of
a
referring
np
is
an
attributive
or
non-referring
one
an
attributive
np
provides
a
description
but
does
not
refer
to
any
particular
individual(s
anyone
or
anything
that
fits
the
description
will
do
attributive
nps
can
often
be
paraphrased
by
whoever
whatever
or
any

a
problem
that
arises
with
expressions
in
which
a
n
is
followed
by
a
pp
is
whether
the
n
and
pp
actually
combine
to
form
a
noun
phrase
as
in
the
examples
in
31
or
whether
they
are
simply
a
non-unified
sequence
of
n
followed
by
pp
as
in
put
the

in
this
expression
the
n
book
is
not
combined
with
the
pp
on
the

into
an
np
it
is
important
to
have
ways
of
identifying
which
kind
of
expression
we
are
dealing
with
remember
that
we
said
that
one
test
for
phrasehood
is
the
possibility
of
being
replaced
by
a
single
word
in
the
case
of
nps
these
words
would
be
pronouns
so
if
a
sequence
of
words
can
be
replaced
by
a
pronoun
then
it
is
very
likely
an
np
for
instance
you
could
replace
all
of
the
expressions
in
31
by
some
form
of
the
word
they
let’s
call
this
test
the
pronoun-substitution
pro-sub
t
est
to
see
how
it
works
let’s
consider

the

to
the
picture
on
the

in

we
get
33a
33
a
woody
admired
it
this
is
grammatical
so
in
32a
the
picture
on
the
wall
is
a
unified
np
when
we
apply
the
pro-sub
test
to
the
same
sequence
of
words
in

we
get

33
b
*woody
put
it
this
is
ungrammatical
showing
us
that
the

on
the

in

is
not

np
if
we
now
apply
the
pro-sub
test
to
the

in

we
get
34
woody
put
it
on

this
is
grammatical
showing
us
that
the
picture
in
32b
is
separate
from

these
patterns
of
grammaticality
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
32a
contains
an
np
made
up
of
a
head
with
a

and
that
32b

*woody

indicates
that

and
thus
that
the
picture
on
the

is
a

the
ungrammaticality
of
32f
indicates
that

fier
of

and
thus
that
the

thus
we
can
conclude
that
the
picture
on

is
a
unified

containing
a

these
examples
indicate
that
the
choice
of
premodifier
genitive
vs
of-geni
tive
depends
on
various
factors
a
the
length
of
the
gennp
the
longer
the
gennp
the
more
like
ly
we
are
to
use
an
of-genitive
e.g
37e
b
whether
the
entity
represented
by
the
genitive
is
animate
or
not
if
it
is
we
are
more
likely
to
use
the
premodifier
genitive
cf
the
cat’s
fur
vs
the
wheel’s
rim
c
if
the
gennp
is
a
pronoun
we
strongly
prefer
the
premodifier
genitive
cf
her
car
vs
*the
car
of
her

choice

a
choice
of
sophie(’s

note
the
meaning
difference
between
her

the
first
can
have
many
meanings
e.g

she
owns/took/ordered/designed/etc
the
second
means
photo
graphs
in
which
she
is
pictured
e
an

a
premodifier
genitive

definite
but
a
post

allows
indefinite
determiners
to

to
have
trouble
with
such
complexi
ties
non-native
students
may
encounter
serious
difficulties
with
this
con
struction
the
second
complexity
is
that
genitive

themselves
contain
a

when
one

we
say
that
the

embedding
allows
one
function

to
contain
other
functions
or
forms
an
understanding
of
embedding
is
critical
to
analysis
of
grammatical
structures
with
any
significant
degree
of
complexity
let’s
illustrate
this
fact
with

to
give
us
my

harry’s

we
could
even
have
selected
another
gennp
under

in
which
case
we
might
have
gotten
harry’s

in

we

embedding
enables

to
be
infinite
in
the
number
and
length
of
the
sentences
it
can
create
fortunately
speakers
tend
to
use
these
possi

sparingly
though
occasionally
writers
such
as
dylan

toy
with
them
as
you
progress
through
this

you
will
see
the
pervasiveness
of
embedding
before
we
leave
premodifiers
of

we
must
address
one
final
matter
namely
the
order
of

are
many

function
as

such
constructions
tend
to
be
brief—one

if
the

is
not
co

however
some
adjectives
can
like

appear
with
their
own

can
head

their
relationship
to
verbs
allows
them
to
have
subjects

amusement

derived
from
amuse

is
a
transitive

so
grammatical
in

with
both
a

that
in

the

of

shows
up
as
a
genitive
premodifier
the
clown’s
and
that
the
direct
object
of
the

in

the

shows
up
as

and

also
differ

object(s
complement
a
phrase
that
obligatorily
follows
a
verb
head
is
called
an
object
or
comple
ment
these
terms
are
sometimes
interchangeable
although
tradition
has
tended
to
attach
object
to
some
constructions
and
complement
to
oth
ers
the
reasons
for
the
variation
are
obscure
the
label
object
dimly
sug
gests
the
goal
or
purpose
of
the
verb
head
though
neither
of
these
semantic
labels
applies
to
every
structure
so
labeled
the
term
complement
suggests
the
notion
of
completing
hence
the
spelling
the
verb
in
some
way
table

lists
the
four
main
types
of
objects

table
8
objects
and
complements
of
verbs
table
8
reveals
that
nps
can
serve
any
object
or
complement
function
that
adjective
phrases
can
also
act
in
complement
functions
and
that
an
entire
clause
or
sentence
can
act
as
the
complement
of
certain
verbs
an
important
grammatical
notion
associated
with
the
direct
object
is
that
of
transitivity
a
transitive
verb
takes
a
direct
object
an
intransitive
verb
does
not
thus
the
sentences
66a-d
contain
transitive
verbs
and
those
in
67a-d
contain
intransitive
verbs
the
direct
objects
in
66
are
italicized

a
moriarty

d
everyone

in
english
a
large
number
of
verbs
can
be
either
transitive
or
intransitive
sometimes
with
a
considerable
difference
of
meaning
68
a
the
fire
smoked
b
shelley
smoked
ambiguous
c
shelley
smoked
the
salmon
thus
whether
such
verbs
are
transitive
or
intransitive
can
only
be
deter
mined
by
their
use
in
an
actual
clause
one
simple
test
is
that
an
intransitive
verb
can
potentially
end
a
complete
clause
as
in
67
t
wo
structures
require
not
one
but
two
phrases
to
follow
the
verb
the
indirect
object
construction
e.g
66c
typically
calls
for
a
direct
object
also
verbs
that
enter
into
such
constructions
are
said
to
be
bitransitive
or
ditransitive
the
object
complement
construction
e.g
66d
requires
a
direct
object
preceding
the
complement
we
deal
in
more
detail
with
these
constructions
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
verbs

imply

products
and/or

clear
in
this
respect
it
is

introduction
until
now
we
have
examined
the
grammar
of
english
in
bits
and
piec
es—phonemes
morphemes
words
and
phrases
in
this
chapter
we
put
these
pieces
together
into
the
basic
grammatical
structure
of
language—the
clause
clauses
are
basic
for
several
reasons
first
you
need
only
one
of
them
to
make
a
sentence
though
of
course
sentences
may
consist
of
an
indefinite
number
of
clauses
second
in
actual
communication
shorter
ut
terances
are
usually
reconstructed
and
understood
by
reference
to
clauses
for
instance
over
here
might
be
understood
as
i’m
over
here
or
shine
the
light
over
here
the
grammatical
importance
of
clauses
probably
reflects
the
fact
that
the
clause
most
directly
represents
the
most
fundamental
structure
of
meaning—the
proposition
a
description
of
a
state
of
affairs
whose
truth
may
be
asserted
questioned
or
otherwise
manipulated
it
doesn’t
make
much
sense
to
say
that
a
clause
represents
a
complete
thought
as
school
grammars
often
do
unless
we
know
what
a
complete
thought
is
a
proposi
tion
is
the
best
model
of
a
complete
thought
whatever
it
is
that
we
have
for
the
present
we
will
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
sense
of
clause
hood
is
intuitive
based
on
our
competence
as
native
speakers
and
perhaps
on
our
status
as
human
makers
of
meaning
although
students
may
need
practice
in
identifying
clauses
of
the
many
reasons
why
we
should
know
about
clauses
we’ll
briefly
discuss
just
four
first
clauses
are
an
important
punctuation
unit
when
a
clause
constitutes
a
whole
sentence
in
written
english
it
must
begin
with
a
capital
letter
and
end
in
a
period
or
its
equivalent
when
multiple
clauses
combine
to
constitute
a
sentence
the
individual
clauses
may
require
spe
cial
punctuation
such
as
separation
by
commas
certainly
the
single
clause
sentence
is
the
best
unit
to
begin
teaching
punctuation
with
second
and
relatedly
writing
teachers
are
concerned
about
sentence
fragments
that
is
non-sentential
units
improperly
punctuated
as
sentential
delahunty
and
garvey
322units
as
we
noted
earlier
fragments
are
typically
internally
grammatical
that
is
they
are
well-formed
phrases
or
clauses
students
must
learn
the
differences
between
clauses
and
their
constituent
units
and
between
clauses
and
sentences
in
order
to
learn
to
punctuate
appropriately
third
a
developed
writing
style
requires
control
of
a
range
of
sentence
types
from
sentences
with
just
a
single
clause
through
sentences
with
an
indefinite
number
of
clauses
a
traditional
technique
for
helping
student
writers
expand
their
repertoires
is
sentence
combining
or
more
accurately
clause
combining
teachers
wishing
to
create
clause
combining
exercises
for
their
students
must
know
about
clauses
especially
if
they
want
to
tai
lor
the
exercises
to
their
students’
actual
needs
fourth
an
important
aspect
of
standard
english
grammar
is
subject
verb
agreement
that
is
the
subject
and
verb
of
a
clause
must
grammati
cally
agree
with
each
other
in
person
and
number
in
order
to
be
able
to
teach
subject
verb
agreement
teachers
must
know
about
subjects
verbs
and
clauses
and
while
the
general
agreement
principle
is
quite
simple
it
is
quite
intricate
in
its
details
which
we
deal
with
in
our
chapter
on
usage
in
book
ii
in
this
chapter
we
first
examine
the
internal
organization
of
clauses
next
we
discuss
the
subject
function
illustrating
the
use
of
formal
characteristics
to
identify
it
we
then
discuss
the
semantic
roles
subjects
and
other
phrases
may
play
in
clauses
the
main
part
of
the
chapter
provides
details
on
seven
major
clause
patterns
in
the
language
elements
of
the
clause
the
basic
functional
analysis
of
a
clause
is
very
simple

in
the
following
pages
we
will
consider
first
the
subject
function
in
ways
that
will
apply
to
all
basic
clause
patterns
we
will
indicate
the
fundamen
tal
forms
of
subjects
and
then
their
meanings
stated
in
terms
of
semantic
roles
we
will
then
turn
to
the
various
types
of
predicates
pointing
out
their
functional
and
formal
characteristics
since
different
patterns
have
differing
types
of
objects
and
complements
we
will
describe
each
pattern
in
a
way
that
expands
slightly
on
the
simple
subject
+
predicate
division
subjects
the
traditional
definition
of
subject
is
what
the
sentence
is
about
a.k.a
the
topic
of
the
sentence
a
traditional
grammarian
would
say
that
sentence
6
is
about
oscar
6
oscar
willed
elmer
his
worm-farm
what
it
says
about
him
is
that
he
willed
elmer
his
worm-farm
predicates
from
a
traditional
point
of
view
complete
a
sentence
by
saying
something
about
its
subject
this
function
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
comment
of
the
sentence
subjects
tend
to
refer
to
entities
that
are
assumed
to
be
already
familiar
to
the
hearer
they
often
represent
what
has
been
variously
referred
to
as
known
old
or
given
information
predicates
generally
contain
the
new
informa
tion
in
a
sentence
the
traditional
definition
of
subject
is
neither
a
formal
functional
nor
semantic
one
rather
it
defines
a
subject
in
terms
of
how
the
sentence
in
which
it
appears
relates
to
the
ongoing
play
of
meaning
in
a
discourse
unfortunately
unless
we
have
a
way
to
accurately
identify
what
a
sentence
is
about
this
definition
is
unusable
and
even
when
we
can
reliably
identify
what
a
sentence
is
about
the
definition
may
give
incorrect
results
as
in
7
7
and
speaking
of
subjects
we
should
identify
them
formally
in
7
given
the
appropriate
context
we
might
argue
that
and
speaking
of
is
a
marker
of
topichood
and
so
the
topic
of
7
is
the
phrase
subjects
though
subjects
is
not
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
shift
from
grammar
to
discourse
is
particularly
serious
when
we
look
at
more
complicated
sentences
such
as

whenever

raking

them
what

of
this
sentence
raking

if
so
it
isn’t
a
subject
if
only
subjects
can
qualify
as
topics
then
either
you
or
i
or
both

be

can
a

have
two

traditional

doesn’t
say

the
traditional

doesn’t

if
every

how
do
you
identify
the

the
traditional
definition
doesn’t
say
in
short
one
cannot
identify
topics
of
sentences
out
of
context
and
when
we
examine
sentences
in
context
the
topics
may
well
turn
out
not
to
be
subjects
thus
the
traditional
discourse-based
criterion
for
establishing
a
grammatical
category
reflects
a
mistaken
notion
of
grammatical
criteria
and
it
just
doesn’t
work

in
this
section
we
present
a
formal
characterization
of

to
replace
the
definition
based
on

we
can
provide
a
more
accurate
and
more
general
characterization
by
using
the
position
agreement
patterns
and
case
markings
of
subjects
in
clauses
consider
the
following
sentences

a
i
am

c
he/she/it
is

d
we/you/they

delahunty

garvey
326there
would
be
universal
agreement
that
the
subjects
of
the
clauses
in
9
are
the
pronouns
i
you
etc
from
these
simple
clauses
we
can
derive
a
general
pattern
namely
that
an
english
subject
typically
occurs
more
or
less
immedi
ately
before
the
verb
of
its
clause
exercise
using
only
the
fact
that
an
english
subject
occurs
more
or
less
imme
diately
before
the
verb(s
of
its

identify
the
whole
subject
of
each

the
following
sentences

there

what

did

run
into
and
how
did
you
solve
them
from
our
discussion
of
pronouns
in
our
chapter
on
minor
parts
of
speech
we
hope
you
remember
that
pronouns
if
they
replace
anything
replace
entire
noun
phrases
it
follows
that
if
we
replace
the
pronouns
in
9
with
more
complex
nps
then
those
more
complex
nps
bolded
must
also
be
the
subjects
of
their
clauses

many
school
grammars
writing
manuals
and
composition
textbooks
identify
the
head

the

phrase
as
the
subject
of
the
clause
some
texts
are
more
careful
and
distinguish
the
simple
subject
from
the
whole
subject
by
simple
subject
they
mean
the
head
of
the
subject
phrase
logi
cally
however
if
a
pronoun
is
the
subject
of
a
clause
then
any
expression
regardless
of
how
complex
that
replaces
the
pronoun
must
also
be
the
sub
327
basic
clause
patternsject
of
that
clause
we
will
follow
the
practice
of
linguists
when
we
speak
of
the
subject
of
a
clause
we
mean
the
entire
subject
if
we
wish
to
refer
to
the
head
of
the
subject
then
we
will
speak
of
the
head
of
subject
we
will
not
use
the
terms
simple
subject
nor
will
we
ever
use
the
term
subject
to
refer
just
to
head
of
the
subject
similar
remarks
apply
to
predicates
objects
complements
and
modifiers
so
please
when
we
ask
you
to
identify
the
subject
object
etc
in
an
expression
identify
the
entire
phrase
not
just
its
head
word
notice
now
that
as
we
changed
the
subject
of
the
clauses
in
9
we
also
changed
the
form
of
the
verb
thus
i
goes
with
am
we/you/they
with
are
he/she/it
with
is
when
two
or
more
parts
of
an
expression
are
mutually
dependent
in
this
way
they
are
said
to
agree
with
each
other
that
is
when
one
is
altered
the
other
must
also
be
altered
notice
too
that
in
order
to
create
grammatical
sentences
our
subjects
must
agree
with
their
verbs
if
they
don’t
the
resulting
strings
of
words
are
not
well-formed
standard
english
sentences
11
a
*i
is
at
home
grammatical
in
some
varieties
b
*we/you/they
am
at
home
c
*he/she/it
are
at
home
the
verb
be
is
the
most
morphologically
complex
verb
in
english
it
has
more
forms
than
other
verbs
see
the
chart
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
and
so
shows
the
agreement
between
subject
and
verb
most
clearly
but
a
reduced
version
of
this
agreement
pattern
can
be
seen
also
in
other
verbs
12
a
i/you/we/they/bill
and
molly
like
rutabagas
b
he/she/it/fred
likes
rutabagas
most
verbs
have
only
two
forms
in
the
present
tense
one
that
ends
in
s
and
another
that
has
no
ending
the
s
form
occurs
with
third
person
singular
subjects
the
uninflected
form
occurs
with
all
other
subjects
so
in
general
english
subjects
must
agree
with
their
verbs
as
well
as
occur
before
them
we
can
use
these
characteristics
of
subjects
to
determine
just
which
of
several
phrases
in
a
clause
is
its
subject
suppose
for
example
that
we
have
a
sentence
in
the
past
tense
with
several

we
wish
to
decide
just
which
of
these
is
the
subject
now
the
s
marker
does
not
occur
in
the
past
tense
there
are
no
verbs
of
the
form
*likeds
in
english
and
except

the
english
past
tense
shows
no
indication
of
agreement
so
to
observe
the
delahunty
and
garvey
328agreement
pattern
we
must
change
the
past
tense
verb
to
the
present
tense
then
we
can
systematically
change
the
nps
in
the
sentence
and
observe
whether
we
must
also
change
the
verb
when
we
find
the
one
and
there
will
be
only
one
np
that
forces
us
to
change
the
verb
in
order
to
create
a
gram
matical
sentence
we
will
have
found
the
subject
of
the
sentence
consider
13
a
i
liked
your
poem
change
13a
to
present
tense
13
b
i
like
your
poem
remember
that
only
a
third
person
singular
subject
requires
the
s
ending
on
the
verb
note
that
your
poem
is
third
person
if
your
poem
were
the
sub
ject
the
verb
would
be
likes
therefore
your
poem
is
not
the
subject
i
is
not
third
person
singular
but
if
we
change
it
to
she
we
have
to
change
the
verb
to
likes
to
maintain
grammaticality
13
c
she
likes
your
poem
we
can
conclude
that
she
is
the
subject
of
13c
and
because
she
replaced
i
in
13b
i
must
be
the

of

what

another
way
to
determine
the

of
a
sentence
is
to
replace
all
its
nps
with
pronouns
the
np
that
can
only
be
replaced
by
a
pronoun
in
the
nomi
329
basic
clause
patternsnative
case
form
will
be
the
subject
thus
14
a
the
man
handed
the
child
to
the
girl
when
we
replace
each
np
with
an
appropriate
pronoun
we
get
14
b
he
handed
him
to
her
the
only
nominative
pronoun
is
he
which
replaced
the
man
so
the
man
must
be
the
subject
of
14a
exercise
using
only
the
case
of
pronouns
identify
the
whole
subject
of
each
of
the
following
sentences

f

what
problems
did
you
encounter
how
did
you
solve
them
it
is
important
to
have
a
variety
of
ways
of
identifying
subjects
because
it
is
not
always
easy
to
identify
them
in
a
specific
sentence
for
example
more
than
one
np
may
occur
before
the
verb
in
a
sentence
15
bill
fred
likes
this
is
called
a
topicalized
sentence
the
first
np
bill
is
not
the
subject
as
we
can
see
by
substituting
pronouns
and
observing
their
case
markings
16
a

c
*he

16a
is
the
only
grammatical
reformulation
of
15
and
as
he
is
the
only
nominative
pronoun
it
must
be
the
subject
of
16a
and
as
it
is
fred
that
is
delahunty
and
garvey
330replaced
by
the
nominative
pronoun
fred
must
be
the

fred
is
also
the
subject
by
the
agreement
test
if
we
replace
fred
by
a
first

form
we
are
forced
to
change
the

this
does
not
happen
if
we

we
can
be

now
that
we
have
developed
ways
to
identify

clause
let’s
examine
another
traditional
definition
of
subject
the
subject
represents
the
doer
of
the
action
this
characterization
sometimes
helps

331
basic
clause
patternshowever
as
a
general
characterization
of
the
subject
it
will
not
do
we
saw
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
that
not
all
verbs
denote
actions
for
example
be
belong
become
seem
ache
know
and
own
denote
states
how
then
can
we
use
the
definition
to
identify
the
subjects
in
20

that

art
institute
b
egworm

moody
today
c
my
sinuses
ache
d
who

the
earth
the
situation
is
even
more
complex
than
this
because
even
verbs
that
do
denote
actions
may
have
subjects
that
do
not
denote
the
doer
of
that
ac
tion
assuming
that
a
doer
is
a
person
or
at
least
an
animate
entity
that
does
something

in
this
section
we
define
a
set
of
terms
developed
by
linguists
to
describe
the
semantic
roles
of
subjects
as
well
as
of
objects
and
other
phrases
in
clauses
consider
the
sentences
22
a
john
broke
the
windshield
b
john
approached
mary
john
is
the
subject
of
both
sentences
in
22
and
in
traditional
grammar
would
have
been
defined
as
the
doer
of
the
actions
of
breaking
the
wind
shield
or
approaching
mary
glossing
the
subject
in
this
way
is
an
attempt
to
provide
a
general
statement
of
the
semantic
relation
between
the
subject
and
the
verb
in
an
indefinite
number
of
sentences
modern
linguists
have
attempted
to
give
a
more
precise
characterization
of
this
relationship
they
would
say
that
john
is
the
agent
of
these
two
sentences
agent
is
defined
as
the
animate
instigator
of
the
action
denoted
by
a
verb
the
term
agent
contrasts
with
other
terms
in
a
set
of
semantic
roles
that
may
be
assigned
to
subjects
and
other
grammatical
relations
compare
the
sentences
of
22
with
the
sentences
of
23
23
a
the
hail
broke
the
windshield
delahunty
and
garvey
332
b
the
wind
knocked
down
the
power
lines
in
23a
the
hail
cannot
be
the
agent
of
the
action
denoted
by
the
verb
this
is
because
hail
is
inanimate
and
so
cannot
be
agentive
by
our
definition
we
will
refer
to
the
inanimate
cause
of
an
event
as
the
force
while
a
force
cannot
be
animate
it
must
have
its
own
potency
to
insist
on
distinguishing
agent
from
force
is
not
to
play
a
mere
terminological
game
lacking
empirical
consequences
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
agent
and
force
in
sentences
22
and
23
consider
what
happens
when
we
add
adverbs
of
willfulness
to
the
sentences
24
a
john
deliberately
broke
the
windshield
b
john
deliberately
approached
mary
25
a
*the
hail
deliberately
broke
the
windshield
b
*the
wind
deliberately
knocked
down
the
power
lines
24a,b
are
perfectly
innocuous
sentences
requiring
no
special
interpreta
tion
25a,b
on
the
other
hand
can
only
be
interpreted
if
we
personify
hail
and
wind
consider
now
26
john
is
in
the
kitchen
in
26
john
although
animate
is
in
no
sense
the
doer
or
instigator
of
an
action
and
therefore
is
not
an
agent
we
will
refer
to
the
semantic
relation
ship
that
john
bears
in
26
as
the
theme
of
the
sentence
theme
is
the
np
referring
to
the
entity
whose
movement
existence
location
or
state
is
predicated

the

define

in
terms
of

a

the

should
give
you
an
indication

how
to
adequately
assign
the
roles
in
specific

we
progress
through
the
various

we

the

helps
us
to
understand
the

before

with
the

basic

we
must
discuss
a
characteristic
that
all

have
in
common—their
capacity
to
include
auxiliary

as
be
have
do
and
the

from
zero
to
four
auxiliary
verbs
although
the
order
of
auxiliary
verbs
is
invariant
the
position
of
the
first
auxiliary
verb
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
its
clause
depends
upon
the
type
of
clause
involved
in
indicative
clauses
it
occurs
between
the
subject
and
the
verb
phrase
in
interrogatives
the
first
auxiliary
is
placed
to
the
left
of
the
subject
in
negative
clauses
the
negator
not
is
placed
immediately
after
the
first
auxiliary
verb

and

because
the
placement
of
the
first
auxiliary
verb
is
affected
by
whether
its
clause
is
interrogative
or
indicative
we
place
it
in
a
special
phrase
which
we
call
aux
for
auxiliary
because
every
clause
may
include
auxiliary
verbs
we
include
aux
in
all
the
formal
patterns
that
we
present
below
we
will
deal
in
more
depth
with
the
placement
of
multiple
auxiliaries
in
our
chapter
on
modifications
of
basic
clause
patterns
tense
and
aspect
what
we
are
calling
basic
clauses
here
are
sentences
consisting
of
a
single
clause
which
we
referred
to
as
simple
sentences
in
our
skeleton
of
english
grammar
chapter
all
english
main
clauses
and
many
types
of
subordinate
clause
must
be
marked
for
tense
and
may
be
marked
for
aspect
we
briefly
introduce
these
two
grammatical
categories
here
and
discuss
tense
more
thoroughly
in
the
appendix
to
this
chapter
t
ense
both
tense
and
aspect
involve
reference
to
time
time
is
a
continuum
on
which
events
succeed
each
other
from
the
past
through
the
present
to
the
future
the
past
is
prologue
and
the
future
is
the
yet-to-be-written
postscript
english
allows
many
ways
to
refer
to
time
in
john
kennedy

assassinated
at
12:30
p.m
on
november
22
1963
for

the
two
twelve

into
which
we
divide

t
ense
is
the
set
of
grammatical
categories
that
languages
use
to
relate
the
time
of
the
situation
denoted
by
the
clause
to
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
said
or
written
grammatical
categories
as
we
have
seen
are
represented
by
elements
of
the
grammar
of
a
language
rather
than
by
its
words
english
gram
matically
distinguishes
three
tenses
past
present
and
future
the
past
and
present
tenses
are
indicated
by
inflectional
morphemes
the
regular
past
tense
is
indicated
by
ed
though
there
are
many
irregular
forms
such
as
was/were
had
did
won
bought
the
regular
present
tense
has
no
marking
unless
the
subject
of
its
clause
is
third
person
singular
in
which
case
the
verb
takes
the
s
inflection
though
again
there
are
a
few
exceptions
such
as
is
has
the
future
is
typically
indicated
by
a
modal
verb
especially
by
will
for
example

basic
clause
patterns
c
she
will

her
linguistics
classes
future
tense
if
there
is
no
auxiliary
verb
in
a
clause
the
tense
is
marked
on
the
main
verb
as
in
56a,b
if
the
clause
does
contain
an
auxiliary
the
tense
will
be
marked
on
the
first
auxiliary
will
in
56c
is
in
the
present
tense
its
past
tense
is
would
compare
the
present
and
past
tense
forms
of
the
auxiliaries
in
57
a
oscar

playing
bridge
b
oscar
has/had
dealt
the
cards
exercise
to
convince
yourself
that
only
the
first
auxiliary
verb
in
a
sequence
may
be
marked
for
tense
observe
what
happens
when
you
move
the
tense
marking
from
the
first
to
the
other
verbs
in
the
pie
might
have
been
eaten
by
the
cat
e.g
*
the
pie
may
had
been
eaten
by
the
cat
you
should
find
that
placing
the
tense
marker
on
any
verb
other
than
the
first
one
results
in
ungrammaticality
very
simplistically
the
past
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
represented
by
the
clause
occurred
prior
to
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
uttered
the
present
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
represented
by
the
clause
overlaps
the
time
at
which
the
clause
is
uttered
and
the
future
tense
indicates
that
the
situation
is
spoken
about
prior
to
when
it
occurs
if
it
ever
does
for
instance
in
58
note
the
correlations
between
the
time
adverbs
yesterday
today
and
tomorrow
and
the
verb
forms
in
the
clauses
they
belong
to
58
yesterday
oscar

while
these

quite
simple
their
actual
uses
are
quite
complex
and
we

them

aspect
aspect
is
the
set
of
grammatical
devices
that
languages
use
to
categorize
situations
according
to
such
characteristics
as
occupying
an
expanse
of
time
taking
only
an
instant
of
time
being
repeated
and
being
complete
al
though

is
probably
much
more
familiar
to
you
than
aspect
aspect
occurs
more
frequently
than

in
the
world’s
languages
english
uses
the
auxiliary
verbs
be
and
have
and
the
idiom
used
to
to
cre
ate
three
grammatical
forms
that
are
regarded
as
aspects
the
progressive
the
perfect
and
the
habitual
respectively
we
distinguish
between
the

sentences
like

the
auxiliaries
be

of
the
progressive

can
be

past

these
aspects
can
occur
together
in
sentences

that
a
situation
that
obtained
in

is
still
rel

at
some
later
time
if
the
sentence
is
a
present
perfect
e.g

the

if

the

is
later

and
may
be

by

adverbial
such
as
by

the
habitual
aspect
indicates
that
a
situation
continued
for
such
an
ex
tended
period
of
time
in
the
past
that
it
can
be
taken
as
a
characteristic
of
the
entire
period
we
explore
the
complexities
involved
in
interpreting
these
forms
in
more
detail
below
progressive
aspect
we
begin
by
illustrating
three
features
of
the
interpretation
of
the
progres
sive
aspect
the
form
indicates
that
the
event
is
viewed
as
involving
a
period
rather
than
merely
a
point
of
time
64
the
jet
changed
direction
65
the
jet
is
changing
direction
the
first
of
these
two
sentences
is
neutral
with
respect
to
whether
the
change
of
direction
is
sudden
or
gradual
the
second
sentence
characterizes
the
change
of
direction
as
taking
time
how
much
time
is
not
at
issue
the
situation
represented
in
the
progressive
aspect
is
viewed
as
temporary
rather
than
permanent
as
illustrated
in
66
and
67
66
i
live
with
my
parents
67
i
am
living
with
my
parents
the
progressive
sentence
is
readily
compatible
with
a
continuation
such
as
while
my
own
house
is
being
rebuilt
the
simple
present
is
not
quite
so
natural
with
that
continuation
the
progressive
suggests
that
the
situation
it
represents
is
not
necessarily
complete
as
68
and
69
show
68
the
man
died
69
the
man
was
dying
the
latter
sentence
is
compatible
with
a
continuation
that
indicates
that
the
dying
process
was
never
completed
but
we
managed
to
save
his
life
the
former
is
not
the
progressive
frequently
represents
a
situation
during
which
another
343
basic
clause
patternssituation
occurs
70
the
burglar
was
leaving
by
the
rear
window
when/as
the
police
arrived
it
is
also
interpreted
as
indicating
repeated
action
when
its
main
verb
rep
resents
events
as
taking
only
a
point
of
time
compare
the
following
71
john
is
hitting
his
carpet
72
john
is
vacuuming
his
carpet
hit
is
understood
as
taking
only
a
point
of
time
vacuum
as
requiring
a
period
so
a
natural
interpretation
of
the
first
is
that
john
repeatedly
hits
his
carpet
the
second
most
naturally
represents
continuous
activity
not
repeated
vacu
umings
the
final
issue
we
raise
in
regard
to
the
progressive
has
to
do
with
the
classes
of
verbs
that
can
occur
in
this
aspect
we
noted
in
our
chapter
on
ma
jor
parts
of
speech
that
all
verbs
except
those
that
refer
to
states
can
appear
as
progressives
thus
verbs
representing
events
whether
momentary
hit
wink
transitional
arrive
leave
action
drink
type
or
process
grow
widen
occur
with
the
progressive
state
verbs
which
include
verbs
of
perception
hear
see
cognition
know
understand
or
having
and
being
be
contain
own
are
not
compatible
with
the
progressive
there
are
however
certain
state
verbs
that
appear
to
be
exceptions
to
this
generalization
one
can
say
for
example
john
is
being
silly
when
we
view
sentences
such
as
this
from
the
perspective
we
have
developed
we
can
see
that
it
really
is
not
particularly
exceptional
compare
it
to
john
is
silly
the
latter
sentence
suggests
that
silliness
is
a
more
or
less
permanent
or
typical
characteristic
of
john
while
the
former
suggests
merely
that
while
john
is
currently
silly
he
is
not
necessarily
typically
or
permanently
so
if
we
were
to
paraphrase
the
former
sentence
we
would
probably
use
a
verb
such
as
act
john
is
acting
silly
so
it
appears
that
be
in
this
kind
of
sentence
is
interpreted
as
an
activity
rather
than
a
state
verb
we
saw
this
kind
of
recategorization
of
words
earlier
in
our
discussion
of
mass
and
count
nouns

consistent
with
the
discussion
of
the
progressive
just
above
i
got
the
idea
for
my
list
a
couple
of
days
after
christmas
dur
ing
a
memorial
service
for
an
old
friend
who
died
of
huntington’s
disease
as
i
sat
listening
to
stories
about
my
friend
i
thought
about
my
brother
john
who
was
diagnosed
with
oral
cancer
in
2005
and
who
is
now
doing
fine
i
also
thought
about
my
father
who
beat
colon
cancer
22
years
ago
a
younger
member
of
my
extended
family

disorder
and

c
you
see
where
this
is
going
with
my
list
in
hand
i’m
working
toward
a
new
way
of
think
ing
about
health
and
disease
illness
is
the
rule
not
the
exception
that
may
sound
depressing
but
if
i
accept
the
idea—and
how
can
i
not
when
i
read
all
those
names?—then
i
have
to
do
more
than
wait
around
for
the
next
dreaded
phone
call
another
thing
i
can
do
is
be
more
useful
to
the
people
on
my
list
like
most
folks
i
usually
make
it
a
point
not
to
think
about
a
friend’s
or
relative’s
health
problems
when
i’m
hanging
out
with
him
but
talking
can
be
a
good
thing
it
may
not
be
easy—for
either
party—but
there’s
no
doubt
that
sharing
the
burden
of
an
illness
can
be
beneficial
perfect
aspect
the
perfect
aspect
represents
an
earlier
situation
as
being
relevant
in
some
way
at
a
later
time
so
it
must
be
distinguished
from
the
simple
past
tense
situa
tions
that
continue
right
up
to
the
time
of
reference
can
be
viewed
in
this
way
as
can
very
recent
situations

i

been
a
taxpayer
since
1980
74
by
2005
i
had
been
a
taxpayer
for
23
long
years
in
73
the
time
of
reference
is
the
time
at
which
the
sentence
is
uttered
so
the
present
perfect
is
used
in
74
the
time
of
reference
is
2005
which
is
before
now
so
the
past
perfect
is
used
both
sentences
imply
that
the
condition
of
being
a
taxpayer
continued
up
to
the
reference
time
the
situation
need
not
be
a
state
or
condition
when
the
verb
represents
an
event
the
sentence
may
represent
repetition
of
that
event
this
usually
requires
an
appropriate
adverbial
phrase
75
we
have
visited
norway
every
july
for
15
years
the
relevance
of
the
situation
represented
by
the
sentence
need
not
be
as
clear
as
the
continuation
of
the
situation
itself
we
have
visited
norway
sug
gests
that
we
made
at
least
one
visit
during
the
period
leading
up
to
the
time
of
utterance
the
situation
may
also
be
interpreted
as
an
event
that
resulted
in
a
state
that
continued
to
the
time
of
reference
the

stopped
implies
that

is

at
which

can
occur
a

all

why
do
you
think
the
author
chose
the

as
basic
for
this
piece
to
help
with
this
last
question
you
might
try
re-writing
the
passage
without
using
the
perfect
for
example
in
the
simple
past
tense
and
comparing
the
two
versions
we
see
rapid
evolution
most
often
where
some
force
often
us
has
given
it
a
jump

suddenly

dramatically

however
these

do
not
strictly

that
these

no

we
could
add

the

in

we
still

note
the

you

why
do
we

the
greater
length
and
complexity
of
some
of
these

arise
not
from
changes
in
the

of

but
because
of
choices
in

and
modifiers
modifiers

have
no

on
the
basic

this
fact
holds
true
even
when
as

is

the

naturally
has
its

by
applying
the

we
developed

as
a
final
remark
on
objects
note
that
most
of
the
semantic
roles
available
to

are
available
also
to
objects
so
objects
may
be

respects

second
feature
common

that
in

must
agree

355
basic
clause
patterns
to
see
the
third
parallel
with
subject
complements
we
must
observe
the
semantic
relation
between
the
direct
object
and
its
complement
if
you
consider
carefully
the
sentences
in
104
and
105
you
will
notice
that
the
semantic
relations
between
the
object
and
its
complement
are
be
and
become
for
instance
in

the

becomes
a
ghastly
color
here
again
the
semantic
role
associated
with
the
complement
is
attribute
the
final
similarity
between
subject
and
object
complements
is
that
the
complement
phrase
and
the
subject
or
object
to
which
it
is
semantically
linked
refer
to
the
same
entity
or

some

366rate
on
our
discussion
of
english
tenses
while
we
believe
that
every
eng
lish
teacher
should
have
a
good
understanding
of
the
tense
system
we
feel
that
a
more
detailed
knowledge
is
most
essential
for
teachers
responsible
for
the
education
of
students
for
whom
english
is
a
second
or
later
language
however
as
we
ground
our
discussion
of
english
tenses
in
their
character
istic
uses
in
texts
we
believe
that
all
teachers
will
find
information
of
value
in
this
appendix
as
we
noted
every
main
clause
and
many
types
of
subordinate
clause
in
english
are
marked
for
tense
t
ense
is
one
way
of
indicating
when
the
situ
ation
represented
by
the
clause
occurs
in
order
to
sensibly
talk
about
tense
we
must
first
talk
a
little
about
time
and
some
other
ways
in
which
time
is
indicated
in
english
we
conceptualize
time
as
a
line
stretching
indefinitely
far
into
the
past
and
indefinitely
far
into
the
future
the
past
is
behind
us
and
the
future
before
us
note
the
spatial
metaphor
here
the
past
is
time
already
gone
the
future
is
time
yet
to
come
however
times
are
past
present
or
future
in
relation
to
some
chosen
point
of
time
that
point
can
be
either
fixed
or
variable
the
fixed
time
may
be
the
time
of
an
important
cultural
event
for
example
the
birth
of
christ
in
the
western
tradition
or
the
birth
of
mohammed
in
the
muslim
tradition
the
variable
time
is
typically
when
an
utterance
is
spoken
the
time
of
utterance
now
however
in
narratives
and
other
text
types
now
is
determined
within
the
text
identifying
the
time
at
which
situations
occur
relative
to
the
fixed
point
of
time
depends
on
systems
for
measuring
time
we
use
cyclic
occurrences
such
as
days
months
and
years
for
measurement
from
the
fixed
time
point
so
as
we
write
this
the
year
is
the
2008th
year
following
the
birth
of
christ
the
choice
of
the
beginning
year
is
relatively
arbitrary
but
some
selection
must
be
made
and
going
back
to
the
big
bang
is
a
bit
inconvenient
exercise

or
vice

again
imagining
that
you
are
teaching
these
patterns
to
someone
who
has
never
encountered
them
might
help
you
to
articulate
them
precisely
we
shift
our
focus
now
to
a
discussion
of
a
system
of
time
reference
that
employs
an
implicit
and
constantly
moving
reference
point
imagine
that
you
call
the
garage
where
you
left
your
car
for
repairs
to
ask
if
the
car
is
ready
the
receptionist
who
answers
the
phone
says
the
mechanic
is
working
on
it
right
now
when
does
now
refer
to
we
can
paraphrase
the
reception
ist’s
answer
as
the
mechanic
is
working
on
it
as
i
speak
so
now
refers
to
the
time
at
which
the
utterance
it
occurs
in
is
said
exercise
how
about
then
does
then
simply
refer
to
times
other
than
those
we
would
refer
to
as
now
or
is
it
somewhat
more
complicated
make
up
some
sentences
with
then
and
work
out
the
rules
for
using
it
many
expressions
besides
now
and
then
depend
for
their
full
interpreta
tion
on
identifying
the
time
at
which
they
are
said
they
include
today
yesterday
and
tomorrow
today
refers
to
the
24
hour
period
beginning
at
midnight
and
extending
to
the
next
midnight
within
which
the
expression
is
said
so
if
on
6/25/2008
i
say
i’ll
do
it
today
then
i
am
saying
that
i
will
delahunty
and
garvey
368do
it
sometime
during
6/25/2008
yesterday
refers
to
the
day
before
the
day
in
which
the
expression
is
said
and
tomorrow
refers
to
the
day
following
the
day
during
which
the
expression
is
said
expressions
that
depend
for
their
full
interpretation
in
this
way
on
when
where
and
by
whom
an
expression
is
uttered
are
called
deictic
expressions
and
the

it
is

to

time
is
a

phe
nomenon
experienced
by
human
beings
tense
is
a
grammatical
category
one
of
several
ways
that
languages
may
use
to
refer
to
time
english
and
many
though
by
no
means
all
other
languages
have
grammaticized
ways
of
indicating
temporal
characteristics
of
states
of
affairs
that
is
ways
that
have
become
part
of
the
grammar
rather
than
the
vocabulary
of
the
lan
guage
a
tense
is
a
grammaticized
way
to
indicate
when
a
state
of
affairs
occurs
relative
to
the
time
of
utterance
that
is
the
time
at
which
that
situation
is
spoken
about
generally
past
tense
refers
to
a
time
earlier
than
the
time
of
utterance
future
tense
refers
to
a
time
later
then
the
time
of
utterance
and
present
tense
refers
to
a
time
that
is
identical
to
or
more
typically
overlaps
the
time
of
utterance
past
tense
we
begin
with
the
english
past
tense
because
we
think
that
its
regular
forms
and
meanings
are
simpler
than
those
associated
with
the
other
tenses
past
tense
forms
the
regular
past
tense
is
formed
by
adding
the
suffix
ed
to
the
word
stem
for
example
delay
delay
ed
print
print
ed
this
suffix
has
three
main
al
lomorphs
t
d
and
id
or
d

is
pronounced
i/@d
when
the
word
it
is
attached
to
ends
in
a
t
or
d
e.g
lifted
t
when
it
is
attached
to
a
word
that
ends
in
a
voiceless
sound
other
than
t
e.g
kissed
and
d
otherwise
e.g
rowed
the
past

marker

is
spelled
in

if
the

ends

basic
clause
patternspast
tense
meanings
the
basic
meaning
of
the
past
tense
is
very
simple
it
indicates
only
that
something
was
the
case
in
the
past
that
is
before
now
if
i
say
john
was
in
his
room
then
i
am
claiming
that
the
description
john
is
in
his
room
held
in
the
past
it
says
nothing
about
whether
john
is
still
in
his
room
he
may
or
may
not
be
as
can
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
the
sentence
above
can
be
followed
by
either
and
he’s
still
there
or
but
he’s
not
there
now
the
situation
represented
as
occurring
in
the
past
may
involve
a
single
point
of
time
1a
repetition
of
events
1b
c
a
period
of

d

chris

the
past
tense
is
compatible
with
completed
situations
and
indeed
many
past
tense
sentences
do
denote
situations
that
ended
in
the
past
the
suggestion
that
the
situation
was
completed
in
the
past
is
due
to
a
number
of
factors
but
not
to
the
past
tense
form
itself
for
example
if
the
event
was
instantaneous
as
in
the
balloon
burst
or
if
the
event
has
a
natural
culmination
such
as
i
wrote
a
poem
he
fell
asleep
or
he
read
the
book
the
situations
will
be
interpreted
as
completed
adverbials
can
be
added
to
in
dicate
specific
lengths
of
time
for
three
hours
or
a
particular
period
of
time
yesterday
or
at
a
particular
time
at
midnight
to
indicate
that
an
activity
occurred
regularly
or
repeatedly
in
the
past
we
can
use
adverbials
that
denote
repetition
e.g
i
walked
to
school
every
day
generally
though
not
necessarily
this
will
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
i
no
longer
walk
to
school
if
we
wish
to
indicate
the
period
during
which
these
walks
took
place
we
can
add
an
adverbial
denoting
a
period
of
time
e.g
as
a
child
if
the
situation
continues
through
the
time
of
utterance
we
can
add
an
adverbial
to
that
effect
e.g
as
i
do
to
this
day
in
texts
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
time
to
be
established
early
and
if
that
time
is
in
the
past
then
succeeding
clauses
are
likely
to
be
in
the
past
tense
for
example
in
the
following
text
the
first
sentence
establishes
the
19th
century
as
the
time
reference
as
a
result
the
verb
bolded
in
each
succeeding
clause
is
in
the
past
tense
delahunty
and
garvey
370the
19th
century
has
been
called
the
linguistic
century
during
that
time
scholars
carried
out
a
great
deal
of
research
into
the
dialects
of
sev
eral
european
languages
they
explored
the
historical
relations
among
the
languages
of
europe
and
parts
of
asia
and
developed
concepts
that
are
still
in
use
in
short
19th
century
philologists
laid
the
foundations
of
modern
linguistics
a
number
of
researchers
have
argued
that
the
past
tense
indicates
distal
events
by
which
they
mean
situations
or
events
removed

my

born
in

as
i
was
because
the
old
man
had
come
there
from
maine
just
to
help
the
free
soilers
establish
the
right
to
vote
because
the
constitution
was
going
to
be

on
that
would
decide
whether
kansas
entered
the

slave
or

quite
a
few
people
went
out
there
at
that
time
for
that
reason
and
of
course
so
did
people
from
missouri
who
wanted
kansas
for
the
south
so
things
were
badly
out

i’ve

considerably

i’ve

my

the
simple
present/non-past
tense
forms
pronunciation
the
english
simple
present
tense
has
two
forms
one
is
created
by
adding
the
suffix
s
to
the
word
stem
if
the
subject
it
agrees
with
is
third
person
singular
for
example
she
read
s
very
quickly
with
other
subjects
the
form
used
is
the
uninflected
form
for
example
i/you/we/they
read
very
quickly
the
s
suffix
has
three
allomorphs
s
z
and
z
or
z
/@z
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
sibilant
consonant
e.g
passes
s
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
voiceless
non-sibilant
e.g
pats
and
z
occurs
when
the
verb
ends
in
a
voiced
non-sibilant
consonant
e.g
pads
and
paws

gets
steps
meanings
the
simple
present
tense
indicates
that
a
state
of
affairs
holds
at
the
time
of
utterance
the
situation
may
extend
indefinitely
far
into
the
past
and/or
into
the
future
all
the
present
tense
indicates
is
that
the
description
applies
at
the
time
of
utterance
however
this
meaning
interacts
in
interesting
ways
with
the
semantics
of
the
main
verb
and
the
present
tense
is
used
conven
tionally
for
certain
types
of
contexts
and
purposes
even
when
present
time
is
not
intended
present
tense
of
state
verbs
the
present
tense
interacts
semantically
with
verb
class
particularly
with
state
and
activity
verbs
we
will
begin
by
illustrating
the
present
tense
with
state
verbs
as
these
are
simpler
for
example
jordan
is
ill
merely
asserts
that
jordan
is
ill
as
the
utterance
is
spoken
he
may
have
been
ill
for
an
indefinite
time
in
the
past
he
may
be
ill
for
an
indefinite
time
in
the
future
or
he
may
have
just
become
ill
and
may
recover
immediately
we
can
demonstrate
that
the
present
tense
is
indifferent
to
the
length
of
time
that
a
situation
lasts
by
showing
that
it
is
compatible
with
contradictory
adverbials
of
time
com
pare
jordan
is
ill
he’s
been
ill
for
years
now
and
it
seems
that
he’ll
be
ill
for
years
to
come
with
jordan
is
ill
he
got
a
sudden
fever
which
will
disappear
as
rapidly
as
it
came
there
are
several
kinds
of
state
verbs
of
which
be
is
the
most
frequent
other
state
verbs
in
the
present
tense
are
interpreted
pretty
much
as
be
is
that
is
as
denoting
a
time
that
extends
through
the
time
of
utterance
and
indefinitely
far
backwards
and
forwards

now
cognitive
state
verbs
i

i

because
the
simple
present
of
state
verbs
denotes
a
state
of
affairs
which
includes
the
present
time
but
may
extend
indefinitely
into
the
past
or
the
future
we
can
indicate
the
extent
of
the
time
involved
by
adding
various
temporal
adverbials
such
as
now
these
days
for
example
she
loves
you
now
but
it
won’t
be
for
long
we
all
live

a
yellow

we
are

but

shortly
present
tense
of
activity
verbs
with
activity
verbs
the
present
is
interpreted
somewhat
differently
i
exercise
denotes
a
series
of
events
rather
than
a
single
exercise
event
the
series
may
extend
indefinitely
into
the
past
and
the
future
even
though
i
may
not
be
exercising
as
i
utter
the
sentence
the
period
of
time
occupied
by
the
series
includes
the
present
time
so
activity
verbs
in
the
simple
present
can
de
note
repetitions
of
events
that
overlap
the
present
time
this
usage
is
often
referred
to
as
the
iterative
temporal
adverbials
may
be
added
to
indicate
how
regularly
or
frequent
ly
the
events
take
place
everyday
regularly
frequently
when
they
occur
at
noon
whenever
i
feel
like
it
when
they
begin
from
6
a.m
when
they
end
till
late
at
night
and
how
long
they
last
for
an
hour
while
watching
the
young

the
restless
for
example
i
exercise
everyday
for
an
hour
from
6
to
7
a.m
many
textbooks
claim
that
the
present
tense
of
activity
verbs
denotes
ha
bitual
or
regular
actions
however
their
examples
typically
include
adverbi
als
indicating
regularity
or
habituality
the
present
tense
itself
says
nothing
about
frequency
or
regularity
the
adverbials

one
can
say
without
contradiction
i

though
neither
frequently

historical

phillips
have
formally
decided
after
doing
it
what
felt
like
a
million
times
they
can
no
longer
be
bothered
to
do
the
future
the
grammar
of
the
future
is
more
complex
than
that
of
the
past
or
present
tenses
there
are
several
grammatical
forms
each
with
different
interpreta
tions
in
english
these
forms
are
not
inflectional
the
most
important
one
the
will
future
is
created
with
a
modal
verb
the
fact
that
the
main
english
future
is
modal
has
led
some
linguists
to
claim
that
english
has
no
future
tense
this
is
certainly
true
if
by
tense
we
mean
inflected
verb
forms
denot
ing
future
situations
however
english
has
several
grammatical
means
of
indicating
futurity
as
you
might
expect
but
probably
didn’t
think
to
put
it
quite
so
oddly
the
future
is
what
now
is
prior
to
mccawley
1981
341
and
the
gram
matical
future
forms
locate
situations
in
time
subsequent
to
the
present
moment
comrie
1985
43
however
the
future
is
conceptually
different
from
the
present
and
the
past
arguably
there
is
only
one
actual
past
and
one
actual
present
but
there
are
many
futures
there
is
the
future
that
we
have
planned
the
fu
ture
we
predict
the
future
we
wish
for
the
future
that
we
have
to
bring
about
and
lots
of
others
and
of
course
there
is
the
future
that
will
actu
ally
occur
although
as
mccawley
remarks
t]he
notion
of
‘actual
future’
may
give
one
a
queasy
feeling
in
view
of
the
fact
that
one
has
very
little
conception
of
which
of
the
infinitely
many
possible
futures
is
the
actual
one
nonetheless
speakers
of
natural
languages
frequently
indulge
delahunty
and
garvey
378in
the
rashness
of
making
statements
that
purport
to
describe
the
actual
future
mccawley
1981
342-4
so
there
are
lots
of
possible
futures
which
is
why
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
for
a
language
to
use
its
modal
system
as
its
main
grammatical
way
of
denoting
futurity
in
this
section
we
describe
the
various
grammatical
forms
used
to
denote
future
in
english
and
the
particular
kinds
of
futures
each
denotes
will
forms
the
form
often
called
the
simple
future
is
created
by
using
the
modal
verb
will
followed
by
an
uninflected
verb
form
jake
will
bring
it
sometimes
especially
in
formal
contexts
and
in
british
english
shall
may
be
used
in
stead
of
will
when
the
subject
of
the
sentence
is
first
person
i
or
we
i
shall
return
we
shall
overcome
meanings
the
will
future
simply
indicates
that
a
situation
will
obtain
in
the
future
relative
to
the
time
of
utterance
when
the
situation
begins
and
how
long
it
lasts
are
irrelevant
to
the
will
future
it
is
compatible
with
situations
that
began
in
the
past
held
through
the
present
and
will
continue
indefinitely
into
the
future
deborah
still
loves
raymond
and
will
love
him
forever
in
this
example
still
indicates
that
the
state
of
affairs
deborah
loves
raymond
held
in
the
past
and
has
held
up
to
now
forever
obviously
indicates
that
the
situation
will
continue
indefinitely
the
will
future
is
also
consistent
with
situations
that
begin
and
end
within
a
very
short
time
in
the
future
the
clock
will
chime
once
at
exactly
midnight
tonight
when
a
state
of
affairs
begins
and
ends
can
be
indicated
by
various
temporal
adverbials
how
long
a
state
of
affairs
lasts
may
also
be
indicated
by
the
nature
of
the
main
verb
specifically
by
whether
or
not
it
is
punctual
as
well
as
by
various
adverbials
the
balloon
will
pop
presently
timothy
will
remain
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
pop
denotes
an
event
that
takes
no
more
than
a
moment
of
time
remain
denotes
a
state
that
occupies
an
indefinite
period
of
time
the
will
future
is
compatible
also
with
events
that
occur
at
specific
times
in
the
future
i’ll
give
you
your
money
at
noon
tomorrow
it
is
also
compatible
with
vague
times
the
earth
will
certainly
be
hit
by
a
large
meteor
but
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
just
when
that
will
happen
like
the
present
and
the
past
the
future
interacts
with
the
type
of
main
verb
involved
with
state
verbs
the
will
future
indicates
an
unchanging
379
basic
clause
patternsstate
of

that
will
hold
in

context
or
adverbials
may
indicate
when
it
began
or
when
it
will
end

verbs
the
future
can
denote
either
single
or
repeated

currences
of

just
which
is
determined
by
other
parts
of
the
sentence
such
as
an

or
a

this

followed
by
the
uninflected

verb
jake
is
going

soon
if
the
be
is
the
first
auxiliary
verb
in
a
tensed
clause
it
must
be
inflected
to
indicate
the
person
and
number
of
its
subject
as
well
as
the
tense
of
the
clause
it
may
be
inflected
for
present
or
past
tense
with
the
past
tense
we
create
a
future
of
a
past
john
was
going
to
leave
but
he
missed
his
plane
stylistically
be
going
to
is
less
formal
than
will
and
is
more
frequent
in
conversational
than
in
written
english
it
is
often
pronounced
g
n
delahunty
and
garvey
380which
is
typically
spelled
gonna
meanings
be
going
to
communicates
a
more
certain
future
than
will
either
because
the
speaker
strongly
intends
to
bring
that
future
about
or
it
has
already
been
planned
i
am
going
to
finish
this
if
it
kills
me
it’s
all
arranged
i
am
going
to
fly
to
los
angeles
next
week
the
future
may
also
be
quite
certain
because
it
results
from
causes
op
erating
in
the
present
the
temperature
is
dropping
it’s
going
to
snow
he’s
12
points
ahead
he’s
going
to
win
the
game
when
used
to
express
the
future
result
of
a
current
cause
be
going
to
communicates
an
inference
that
the
result
will
occur
almost
immediately
this
suggestion
of
immediacy
appears
to
be
due
to
pragmatic
factors
if
the
result
is
not
going
to
be
immediate
then
the
speaker
may
override
the
infer
ence
with
a
temporal
adverbial
such
as
next
month
next
year
in
2009
for
example
current
weather
trends
indicate
that
we
are
going
to
have
very
cold
weather
next
week/month/year
in
spite
of
their
differences
will
and
be
going
to
are
often
interchangeable
without
much
apparent
effect
for
example
they
will
be
in
the
hospital
for
ten
days/they
are
going
to
be
in
the
hospital
for
ten
days
i
think
it’ll
rain/i
think
it’s
going
to
rain
in
other
cases
substituting
be
going
to
for
will
causes
significant
changes
of
meaning
for
example
expressing
an
intention
with
will
allows
it
to
be
interpreted
as
an
offer
i’ll
bring
dessert
whereas
expressing
that
intention
with
be
going
to
suggests
a
fixed
plan
i’m
going
to
bring
dessert
it
may
also
suggest
the
speaker’s
expectation
that
someone
might
try
to
thwart
their
intention
compare
i’ll
answer
it
with
i’m
going
to
answer
it
when
the
phone
rings
similarly
substituting
be
going
to
for
will
in
requests
and
promises
causes
them
to
seem
either
preemptory
and
intrusive
or
questions
about
statements
of
fact
are
you
going
to
bring
the
beer
this
time
i
am
going
to
help
you
on
saturday
whether
you
like
it
or
not
in
some
contexts
substituting
will
for

results
in
ungrammati
cality

introduction
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
we
dealt
with
simple
sentences
that
is
sentences
that
contain
only
one
clause
consisting
of
an
np
subject
aux
and
vp
predicate
in
this
chapter
we
examine
sentences
in
which
elements
of
simple
sentences
are
moved
from
their
canonical
positions
are
understood
even
though
no
words
are
present
and
in
which
certain
kinds
of
elements
are
inserted
into
clauses
to
fulfill
certain
functions
in
order
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
movement
deletion
and
insertion
we
will
introduce
elements
from
a
theory
of
syntax
called
transformational
gram
mar
specifically
we
will
distinguish
between
a
clause’s
deep
structure
ds
the
nature
of
which
we
will
make
clear
later
and
its
surface
structure
ss
i.e
the
form
it
actually
occurs
in
we
will
also
introduce
transformational
rules
i.e
the
rules
that
move
delete
and
insert
linguistic
elements
in
the
journey
from
deep
to
surface
structure
as
we
go
along
we

movement
we
begin
by
examining
sentence
variations
that
involve
the
movement
of
elements
from
one
position
to
another
in
a
clause
we
begin
with
one
of
the
simplest
of
these
variations
particle
movement
particle
movement
particles
are
words
such
as
up
or
over
that
may
occur
as
prepositions
when
they
take
their
own
np
objects
or
as
adverbs
when
they
modify
vs
or
vps
when
these
words
combine
with
a
verb
to
create
an
idiomatic
unit
they
are
called
particles
for
example
combining
look
and
up
creates
the
phrasal
verb
look
delahunty
and
garvey
384up
in
the
following
sentences
1
a
bill
looked
up
the
number
b
bill
looked
the
number
up
these
two
sentences
differ
only
in
the
position
of
the
particle
up
in
the
first
it
occurs
between
the
verb
and
the
object
in
the
second
to
the
right
of
the
object
both
sentences
contain
the
same
words
and
the
phrases
par
ticularly
the
nps
perform
the
same
grammatical
functions
in
both
bill
is
the
subject
the
number
is
the
direct
object
moreover
the
two
sentences
are
synonymous
by
this
we
mean
specifically
that
the
semantic
roles
see
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
assigned
to
the
nps
are
the
same
in
both
sentences
bill
is
the
agent
and
the
number
is
the
theme
as
native
speak
ers
we
can
assert
these
facts
with
certainty
and
expect
universal
agreement
among
english
speakers
because
knowledge
of
the
relationships
between
sentence
pairs
like
these
is
part
of
every
native
english
speaker’s
competence
it
must
be
expressed
in
a
grammar
at
issue
is
how
to
do
this

can
assign
the

similar
speakers
of
english
know
that
the
sentences
they
represent
are
related
that
they
are
variant
forms
of
each
other
if
we
assume
that
a
goal
of
our
grammar
is
to
represent
native
speakers’
linguistic
knowledge—their
linguistic
competence
then
we
have
to
represent
the
relationship
between
pairs
of
sentence
like
1a,b
we
will
adopt
a
strategy
similar
to
the
one
we
adopted
in
phonology
and
morphology
namely
that
variant
forms
e.g
allophones
and

are

to

ent
representations

of

form
so
1a,b
are
different
surface
manifestations
of
an
abstract

that
they
have
in
common
much
as
the

s

this

of

and
their

are
the

the
deep

and
surface

of
a
sentence
are
connected
by
transforma
tional
rules
or
just
transformations
which

items
we
will
make
a
few
assumptions
about
deep

first
they
are
created
by
phrase
structure
rules
psrs
like
those
in
3
second
elements
that
are
semantically
closely
related
must
be
syntactically
closely
related
in
ds
so
for
example
in
particle
sentences
such
as
1a,b
because
the
par
ticle
and
verb
are
closely
associated
semantically
they
must
be
closely
associ
ated
in
ds
consequently
we
should
prefer
look
up
the
number
rather
than
look
the
number
up
as
the
ds
arrangement
of
words
third
as
we
will
discuss
in
greater
depth
later
if
a
verb
assigns
a
semantic
role
to
an
np
then
that
np
must
be
in
the
same
clause
as
the
verb
we
have
now
argued
that
2a
represents
the
ds
of
both
1a
b
the
sur
face
structure
of
1a
is
identical
in
all
relevant
respects
to
its
deep
structure
the
surface
structure
of
1b
is
slightly
different
from
its
deep
structure
specifically
regarding
the
position
of
the
particle
we
account
for
this
slight
difference
by
hypothesizing
a
transformation
called
particle
movement
pm
which
moves
a
particle
from
its
deep
structure
position
beside
its
verb
places
it
to
the
right
of
the
direct
object
and
attaches
it
to
the
vp
this
delahunty
and
garvey
386yields
the
surface
structure
2b
the
transformational
approach
has
the
advantage
of
expressing
by
the
common
deep
structure
native
speakers’
knowledge
that
pairs
of
sentenc
es
like
1a,b
are
grammatically
related
the
grammar
represents
the
two
sentences
as
transformational
variants
of
each
other
analogous
to
the
ways
in
which
allophones
and
allomorphs
are
related
to
each
other
as
variants
of
underlying
abstract
phonemes
or
morphemes
assigning

fact
that
the

particle

has

then
the
answer
to
this
should
be
clear
from
the

above
pm
is
gen
erally
optional
but
it
must
apply
if
the
object
is
a

it
seems
plau
sible
to
assume
that
at
least
one
factor
in
determining
where
to
place
the
particle
is
the
informational
status
of
the
object
np
if
the
np
represents
old
known
or
given
information
and
pronouns
are
typically
in
this
cat
egory
then
the
particle
moves
to
the
right
if
the
np
represents
new
information
the
particle
is
placed
between
v
and
np
this
is
an
example
of
the
interaction
between
the
syntactic
and
pragmatic
components
of
the
grammar
another
factor
and
probably
the
more
important
one
is
the
length
of
the
object
np
the
longer
the
np
the
more
likely
the
particle
is
to
appear
before
rather
than
after
it
as
the
following
sentences

as

every

consider

the

mary

mary
bill
carried
in
both
of
these
sentences
bill
is
the
agent
and
mary
is
the
theme
note
however
that
mary
occurs
in
two
different
positions
in
these
sentences
in
7a
it
occurs
in
the
direct
object
position
in
7b
it
is
in
what
is
known
as
the
topic
position
speakers
of
english
know
that
both
of
these
sentences
denote
that
bill
carried
mary
let’s
assume
that
we
have
a
rule
whereby
carry
assigns
theme
to
its
direct
object
in
sentences
like
7a
must
we
now
as
sume
that
we
need
another

for
the
assignment
of

to

let’s
examine
that
possibility
such
a

might
say
assign

to
the

directly
to

of

mary

but
we
can
insert

many
that-clauses
between
mary

as
we
wish
there
is
no
principled
bound
to
the
number
of
such
clauses
it
follows
that
for
an
infinite
number
of
sentences
we
would
need
an
infinite
number
of
rules
to
assign
theme
to
mary
clearly
such
a
set
of
rules
could
not
exist
in
anyone’s
mind
we
must
therefore
find
an
alternative
way
of
assigning
a
semantic
role
to
all
these
different
but
related
positions
rather
than
devise
a
complex
set
of
rules
that
would
directly
assign
theme
to
mary
in
all
these
positions
linguists
have
simplified
the
assign
ment
process
by
assuming
something
like
the
following
a
verb
such
as
carry
assigns
theme
to
its
deep
structure
direct
object
this
phrase
may
afterwards
be
moved
by
transformations
though
it
will
always
be
associated
with
its
original
deep
structure
position
and
therefore
with
its
semantic
role
in
support
of
this
idea
note
that
we
cannot
put
another
np
into
the
object
position
and
still
interpret
the
resulting
s
as
mary
is
carried
by
bill
9
mary
bill
carried
susie
we
can
only
interpret
mary
in
9
as
an
addressee
and
not
as
a
direct
object
susie
has
taken
over
that
role
because
mary
can
no
longer
be
associated
with
the
do
position
it
cannot
be
interpreted
as
theme
so
the
deep
struc
ture
position
with
which
a
moved
phrase
is
associated
and
from
which
it
derives
its
semantic
role
must
be
empty
let’s
now
think
about
the
position
that
the
topicalized
phrase
occupies
in
surface
structure
there
are
various
possibilities
one
is
that
topicalization
inserts
the
topicalized
phrase
directly
under

however
we
will
introduce
a

a

this
associa
tion
is
represented
by
the
transformation
that
moves
the

it
follows
that
there
can
be

will
call

are
those
positions
within

functions
of

every
native
speaker
of

knows
that
topicalized
and
non-topicalized
sentences
express
essentially
the
same
message
the
semantic
roles
of
the
various
nps
in
the
sentences
are
unchanged
by
the
movement
there
is
nonetheless
a
difference
between
the
two
forms
the
non-topicalized
is
a
more
general-purpose
construction
than
the
topicalized
which
we
would
use
only
in
special
contexts
the
most
typical
reaction
speakers
of
english
have
upon
hearing
sen
tences
such
as
14
the
forks
you
put
on
the
left
is
that
the
entity
or
entities
referred
to
by
the
topic
np
the
forks
have
al
ready
been
introduced
directly
or
indirectly
into
the

so
14
might
occur
as
the
answer
to
15
which
side
do
i
put
the
forks
on
a
second
and
closely
related
use
of
topicalized
sentences
is
to
refer
to
an
entity
that
is
a
member
of
a
set
of
related
entities
that
has
already
been
introduced
into
the

a
typical
other
sentence
to
go
along
with
14
might
be
16
and
the
knives
you
put
on
the
right
knives
and
forks
are
members
of
the
set
of
silverware
items
and
if
you
came
upon
a
conversation
in
which
14
was
the
first
sentence
you
heard
delahunty
and
garvey
392you
could
reasonably
assume
that
the
speakers
had
already
mentioned
silverware
and
one
speaker
was
now
listing
the
individual
members
of
the
silverware
set
and
telling
a
child
for
example
where
each
one
goes
in
a
place
setting
so
the
np
in
topic
position
can
refer
to
a
member
of
a
set
of
items
that
has
already
been
introduced
into

just
to
show
you
that
we’re

because

that
they
raise
interesting
issues

language

fundamentally
a
speaker
using
an
imperative
assumes
that
the
addressee
will
do
what
the
sentence
ex
presses

studies
of

suggest
that

some
discourse
functions
of
deletion
the
fundamental
function
of
deletion
is
to
make
processing
discourse
easier
for
both
its
producers
and
its
audiences
the
producer
has
to
say
or
write
less
the
audience
has
less
to
hear
and
process
our
minds
derive
inferences
jump
to
conclusions
more
rapidly
than
they
process
linguistic
input
so
deletion
takes
advantage
of
that
difference
in
processing
speed
by
reducing
linguistic
input
and
allowing
the
mind
to
fill
in
the
blanks

subtle
differ
ences

the

not

corresponds

how
are
we
to
represent
the
similarities
and
differences
between
such
sentences
as
you
have
probably
guessed
at
this
point
a
modern
linguist
is
likely
to
say
that
they
are
transformationally
related
that
is
they
both
have
deep
structures
similar
to
40a
but
the
derivation
of
40b
involves
a
transfor
mation
that
moves
the
subject
phrase
into
the
vp
and
another
that
inserts
there
into
the
vacated
subject
slot
what
gives
us
the
right
to
say
that
the
np
that
follows
the
verb
is
the
subject
in
existential

generally

their

english

a
note
on
the
use
of
passive
sentences
style
manuals
and
many
school
grammars
and
composition
textbooks
ad
vise
students
and
writers
generally
to
avoid
the
passive
however
research
has
demonstrated
that
student
writers
use
the
passive
less
often
than
expert
writers
garvey
and
lindstrom
1989
it
would
appear
therefore
that
what
students
need
to
learn
is
how
to
use
the
passive
appropriately
a
piece
of
advice
that
applies
to
all
sentence
types
there
are
two
major
traditional
objections
to
passives
first
they
are
alleged
to
be
deceitful
they
can
and
often
do
omit
reference
to
the
agent
responsible
for
an
event
second
because
they
begin
with
an
np
whose
se
mantic
role
is
not
an
agent
and
include
a
form
of
be
they
are
alleged
to
be
weak
in
response
to
the
first
objection
we
say
that
omitting
pieces
of
sentences
is
not
something
that
only
passives
can
do
many
if
not
all
sentence
types
can
so
in
this
regard
writers
need
to
decide
just
what
information
must
be
presented
and
what
can
be
omitted
from
a
text
this
is
a
matter
of
audience
not
just
of
grammar
in
response
to
the
second
objection
most
languages
of
the
world
have
constructions
that
correspond
to
the
english
passive
it
would
be
most
un
likely
for
these
constructions
to
have
developed
and
been
retained
if
they
were
not
of
considerable
value
what
they
do
is
allow
the
information
rep
delahunty
and
garvey
406resented
in
the
active
to
be
restructured
because
old
familiar
or
given
in
formation
tends
to
be
placed
before
new
information
so
that
it
can
be
easily
connected
with
its
prior
context
passive
allows
old
information
that
would
be
placed
later
in
the
corresponding
active
to
be
appropriately
placed
earlier
additionally
truncation
deletion
of
the
agentive
phrase
from
a
passive
allows
speakers
and
writers
to
efficiently
avoid
repeating
information
that
may
be
readily
derivable
from
the
context
omission
of
the
agentive
phrase
also
allows
scholars
a
polite
way
to
criticize
each
other

the

in

is

depends
upon
a
number
of
factors
including
whether
it
is
already

the

whether

is
topical
and
whether

syncratic

so
must

introduction
the
discussion
in
this
chapter
depends
on
a
distinction
between
sentences
and
clauses
clauses
as
we
noted
are
grammatical
units
comprising
one
subject
and
one
predicate
and
consequently
one
main
verb
sentences
are
grammatical
units
comprising
one
or
more
clauses
an
understanding
of
the
ways
in
which
clauses
combine
to
form
sentences
is
valuable
to
teach
ers
helping
students
develop
more
sophisticated
writing
skills
multi
clause
sentences
allow
the
integration
of
several
propositions
into
a
single
gram
matical
unit
one
hallmark
of
good
style
is
an
appropriate
sequencing
of
simple
and
complex
sentences
the
ability
to
compose
appropriately
com
plex
sentences
can
be
fostered
by
clause-combining
exercises
multi
clause
sentences
the
clauses
that
constitute
multi
clause
sentences
can
be
combined
either
by
coordination
subordination
or
both
called
complex
compound
and
compound-complex
sentences
respectively
the
most
inclusive
clause
in
each
sentence
is
its
main
clause
in
light
italics
in
the
examples
just
below
which
must
be
marked
as
either
present
or
past
tense
that
is
it
must
be
finite
a
subordinate
clause
is
grammatically
dependent
on
some
element
in
another
clause
it
may
function
as
a
subject
complement
or
modifier
in
the
higher
clause
a
complex
sentence
contains
one
or
more
subordinate
clauses
bolded
e.g
hofstetter
believes
that
he
is
being
targeted
by
homeland
security
agents
in
compound
or
coordinated
sentences
two
or
more
clauses
are
brought
together
as
grammatical
equals
connected
by
a
coordinating
con
junction
bolded
to
one
another
e.g
many
people
can
identify
parts
of
speech
but
they
cannot
justify
their
identification
because
no
clause
in
a
compound
sentence
is
subordinate
to
another
by
definition
all
the
clauses
in
a
com
pound
sentence
are
main
clauses
compound-complex
sentences
are
a
combination
of
complex
and
com
delahunty
and
garvey
412pound
sentences
they
may
consist
of
coordinated
clauses
bolded
that
are
subordinate
to
another
clause
e.g
edgeworth
believed
that
novels
should
have
redeeming
social
value
and
that
her
writing
might
help
improve
social
conditions
or
one
or
more
of
the
coordinate
clauses
may
include
one
or
more
subordinate
clauses
bolded
e.g
compound-complex
sentences
consist
of
at
least
two
coordinate
clauses
and
at
least
one
of
those
must
contain
a
clause
which
is
subordinate
to
it
to
orient
ourselves
let’s
recall
that
in
our
chapter
on
major
parts
of
speech
we
distinguished
between
intransitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
are
in
compatible
with
a
direct
object
such
as
cought
laugh
lie
transitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
a
direct
object
such
as
bite
consume
transmit
bi
transitive
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
a
direct
and
an
indirect
object
such
as
give
offer
send
linking
verbs
i.e
those
that
link
a
subject
with
a
sub
ject
complement
such
as
be
become
seem
and
object
complement
verbs
i.e
those
that
require
both
a
direct
object
and
a
complement
associated
with
that
object
such
as
consider
elect
name
we
revisited
this
subcatego
rization
of
verbs
in
our
chapter
on
phrases
where
we
dealt
with
the
distinct
vps
associated
with
each
type
in
our
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
we
added
np
subjects
to
those
vps
to
create
clauses
built
around
each
of
these
verb
types
we
illustrated
objects
with
nps
and
complements
with
nps
and
aps
in
this
chapter
we
substitute
clauses
for
the
nps
that
functioned
in
the
chapter
on
basic
clause
patterns
as
subjects
direct
objects
indirect
ob
jects
and
subject
and
object
complements
we
will
begin
with
subordinate
finite
clauses
clauses
that
are
marked
for
either
present
or
past
tense
and
move
on
to
non-finite
clauses
those
that
are
not
marked
for
present
or
past
tense
then
we
will
continue
the
discussion
we
began
in
phrases
and
mi
nor
parts
of
speech
on
modifying
clauses
including
relative
clauses
which
are
modifiers
in
nps
and
adverbial
clauses
which
modify
vs
vps
and
clauses
we
wrap
up
this
chapter
with
a
brief
discussion
of
a
few
sentence
types
that
are
designed
to
allow
for
alternative
ways
of
presenting
informa
tion
in
sentences
we
begin
with
a
brief
overview
of
how
one
clause
is
included
within
another
technically
known
as
recursion
recursion
the
possibility
of
creating
multi
clause
sentences
depends
on
a
characteristic
of
language
called
recursion
recursion
is
the
possibility
of
allowing
a
gram
matical
category
to
recur
inside
another
instance
of
the
same
category
for
example
an
np

only
at
the
begin
nings
of
subordinate

the
restrictive
relatives
clauses
that
we
have
been
examining
are
typically
interpreted
as
providing
information
necessary
for
identifying
the
referent
of
the
entire
np
another
kind
of
relative
clause
the
non-restrictive
sup
plies
extra
information
that
is
not
considered
necessary

identify

b
the
claim
which
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
the
non-restrictive
relative
34a
refers
to
some
claim
and
then
adds
the
supplementary
information
that
the
claim
is
fully
supported
by
the
evi
dence
the
reader/hearer
is
assumed
to
know
which
claim
is
being
referred
to
without
this
extra
information
the
restrictive
relative
34b
refers
to
a
claim
that
is
assumed
to
be
identifiable
only
by
using
the
information
in
the
relative
clause
to
distinguish
the
intended
claim
from
other
claims
one
syntactic
effect
of
this
difference
between
restrictive
and
non
restrictive
relatives
is
that
the
head
of
a
non-restrictive
but
generally
not
of
a
restrictive
may
be
a
proper
noun

is
well

range
b
*bill
who
is
well
known
to
all
of
us
will
sing
his
favorite
tune
home
on
the
range
one
explanation
for
this
is
that
the
referents
of
proper
nouns
are
assumed
to
be
identifiable
by
hearers/readers
without
extra
information
restrictive
relatives
whose
information
is
assumed
to
be
essential
for
the
identification
of
the
referent
are
therefore
redundant
with
proper
nouns
non-restric
tive
relatives
modifying
proper
nouns
whose
information
is
assumed
to
be
supplementary
are
not
redundant
we
do
however
find
sentences
such
as
the
following
which
might
be
used
in
a
situation
in
which
there
are
several
individuals
called
bill
in
that
case
the
usual
assumption
associated
with
proper
names
may
be
suspended
and
the
specific
bill
being
referred
to
can
be
identified
by
a
restrictive
clause
36
the
bill

has
the
rose
between
his
teeth
we
turn
now
to
some
formal
differences
between
restrictive
and
non
restrictive
relatives
that
we
mentioned
above
restrictive
relative
clauses
may
be
introduced
by
either
a
wh-word
that
or
zero
non-restrictive
clauses
may
be
introduced
only
by
wh-words

relative
clauses
may

nouns
they
modify

non-restrictives
may

particularly
important

discussions
of
conditionals
usually
divide
them
into
two
major
types
the
hypothetical

consider

the
formal
differences

the
following
sentences
51
a
we
think
the
ghost

at
midnight
b
we
want
the
ghost
to

we
can
see
that
both
are
clauses
since
each
has
a
subject
np
the
ghost
and
a
vp
appear/s
at
midnight
however
the
italicized
clause
in
51a
is
a
finite
clause
it
is
in
the
present
tense
and
its
subject
agrees
with
its
verb
we
could
even
include
a
modal
in
it

an
easy
way
to

a

is
to
look
at
its
first
verb
if
it
is
in
the
present
or

or
if

is

called
extraposition
from
np
one
reason
why
english

many
other
languages
allows
extraposition
and
extraposition
from

is
that
clauses
tend
to
be
relatively
long
and
so
if
they

not

they
may
disrupt
the

sentences

somewhat
easier

another
reason
might
be
that
while

the

simply
as

which
may
be
any

type
except
vp
and
a

that
looks

actually

clause
the

is
like

in

cases

the
fact
that

be

has

to
suggest
that
the

was
actually
moved

position
in

cleft

are
often
interpreted
as
contrasting
with
some

for
example
you
might
use
a

such
as
the
ones
above
if
you
thought
that

personal

bothered
her
only
insofar
as

she

trained
herself
to
withstand
any
discomfort
that
could
come
along
discomforts
of
either
body
or

the
mind
was
more
difficult

limitless
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
the
stars
in
the
course
of
her
studies
she
had
read
that
what
fueled

was
the
merging

science
what
fascinated
her
was
the
notion
that
the

the

was

concluding
remarks
in
this
chapter
we
explored
the
major
grammatical
structures
that
enable
english
speakers
to
create
sentences
of
infinite
length
and
complexity
de
spite
the
intricacy
and
variety
they
make
possible
finite
and
non-finite
sub
ordinate
clauses
are
individually
fairly
simple
each
has
a
rather
limited
set
of
formal
properties
and
we
have
had
to
add
very
few
functions
to
describe
their
workings
but
the
process
of
embedding—of
building
structures
with
in
structures—multiplies
the
potential
for
variety
exponentially
we
have
only
scratched
the
surface
of
that
potential

the
english
language
from
sound
to
sense
offers
readers
who
have
little
or
no
analytic
understanding
of
english
a
thorough
treatment
of
the
various
components
of
the
language
its
goal
is
to
help
readers
become
independent
language
analysts
capable
of
critically
evaluating
claims
about
the
language
and
the
people
who
use
it
written
in
a
clear
style
it
guides
its
readers
on
topics
including
basic
assumptions
about
language
and
discourse
pronunciation
word-formation
strategies
parts
of
speech
clause
elements
and
patterns
how

in
the
analytic
methods
that

to
provide
its
readers
with
a
broad
spectrum
of
basic
knowledge
about
english
its
stance
is
rigorously
descriptive
but
the
object
of
its
description
is
the
standard

making

an
invalu
